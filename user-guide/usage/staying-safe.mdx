## How to check if a token is safe to LP in?

### Potential Token Risk Warning

Pools with suspicious or riskier tokens would display a “Potential token risk” warning message at the top of the pool detail page.

### Rugcheck

Prior to purchasing the token, you can try pasting the token address on https://rugcheck.xyz/ to check if it has any risks.

Sometimes, the token being traded might have a “Freeze Authority” function attached, which means the token minter or creator has the ability to freeze the buying/selling/transfer of the token by users. 

Please clarify this with the token project and exercise caution when trading this token. In addition, you should always be wary of scams and phishing attempts.

### JupShield

On the pool list page, as well as each pool detail page, we have integrated JupShield by Jupiter, which combines its own scam-mitigation tech with other third-party services like RugCheck and Blockaid to provide real‑time protection by flagging potentially risky tokens and liquidity pools. Examples include tokens involved in rugpulls, suspicious mint activity, with Freeze Authority enabled, or with low liquidity. Users can easily see the warnings for the token on the page prior to purchasing the token or adding liquidity into the pool.

### Jupiter Organic Score

Meteora has also integrated Jupiter’s Organic Score, a metric used to measure the authentic engagement and on-chain activity of a token. Unlike raw volume or liquidity figures—which are easily faked or inflated by bots—this score focuses on real user activity, making it a stronger indicator of genuine interest. It considers factors such as:
- Holder count
- Trading volume (from real wallets, not bots)
- Liquidity trends
- Other heuristics that ensure reliable detection of organic token growth

<Tip>Before you trade or add liquidity for a specific token, please conduct your own due diligence and assess the token’s risks on Rugcheck, JupShield, and Jupiter Organic Score.</Tip>

### Compromised Wallets

What should you do if your wallet is compromised?

Unfortunately, if your wallet has been compromised, the best approach would be to transfer your assets to a new wallet immediately and LP with the new wallet.

Please always be wary of scams, phishing links, and downloading any programs. Team members would never DM you directly or ask you to join another discord. NEVER give or show your wallet’s private key to anyone.

For any points, airdrop, or rewards system, it would be extremely challenging to verify the original owner of the compromised wallet once multiple malicious parties have access to it.
