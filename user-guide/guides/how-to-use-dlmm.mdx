## Navigating DLMM pools

Meteora’s DLMM, or Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker, is a dynamic liquidity protocol designed to boost fee earnings for liquidity providers on Solana.

Unlike AMM DEXes, where token liquidity is allocated inefficiently across an infinite price range, on DLMM, you have the freedom to adjust your price range, concentrating liquidity where it matters most.

On the Pool List page, once you’ve selected the token pair and DLMM pool you’d like to add liquidity into, click on it and you would enter the specific pool’s detail page.
