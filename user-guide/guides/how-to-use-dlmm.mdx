## Navigating DLMM pools

Meteora’s DLMM, or Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker, is a dynamic liquidity protocol designed to boost fee earnings for liquidity providers on Solana.

Unlike AMM DEXes, where token liquidity is allocated inefficiently across an infinite price range, on DLMM, you have the freedom to adjust your price range, concentrating liquidity where it matters most.

On the Pool List page, once you’ve selected the token pair and DLMM pool you’d like to add liquidity into, click on it and you would enter the specific pool’s detail page.

For this example, we will be using a SOL-USDC pool.

### Total Value Locked (TVL)

At the top left of the pool detail page, you can view the pool’s TVL (Total Value Locked). This is the total amount of token assets in the pool in terms of $USD value (how much all the tokens currently in the pool are worth).

### Liquidity allocation

The TVL is further broken down into the amount of each token in the pool. In this screenshot example, $1,632,497 in TVL is actually made up of 5,702.33 SOL and 649,914.70 USDC.

In the Liquidity Allocation section, you can view a snippet of the token’s contract address. Click the icon next to it to access important quicklinks; to copy the token’s contract address, view the contract address on solscan, check for token risks on Rugcheck.xyz, or analyze the token behaviour on Bubblemaps.

<Tip>You can also view the Jupiter Organic Score for the token and if the token has any risks. </Tip>


### Liquidity Distribution

Here you can quickly take a quick look at the pool’s liquidity distribution chart to have a better understanding on where and how liquidity is currently distributed in the pool so that you can make more informed decisions when LPing. You’re able to click the magnifying glass icon to zoom in or zoom out if required.

### Pool Details

#### Bin Steps

Each bin represents a single price point, and the difference between 2 consecutive bins is the bin step. Similar to tick size, a higher bin step means a larger jump from one price to the next.

- **Smaller bin step**: Allows you to capture more volume, but your max range per position is smaller, with more limited base fee options. Generally, use smaller steps for more stable pairs and larger steps for more volatile pairs.
- **Larger bin step**: Allows you to set a higher base fee and a wider price range per position, but at the cost of less volume, since there's a less continuous price range (harder for liquidity to be picked up for swaps). But useful for highly volatile pairs where price swings can be huge.

#### Base Fee

Minimum trading fees earned when swaps occur through the liquidity position

#### Max Fee

Maximum trading fees earned when swaps occur through the liquidity position

#### Protocol Fee

Amount of fees charged on each trade which goes to the protocol or integrations. For standard DLMM pools, Protocol Fee is typically 5% of the Dynamic Fee.

#### Dynamic Fee

LPs can earn more with Dynamic Fees, which surge in response to real-time price volatility. For DLMM, Dynamic Fee includes the Base Fee.

#### 24h Fee

Total Fees collected by the pool in 24h

### 24h Fee / TVL %

At the top-right corner of the pool detail page, you’ll find the 24h fee-to-TVL ratio — calculated by dividing the fees collected over the past 24 hours by the current TVL, and expressed as a percentage.
