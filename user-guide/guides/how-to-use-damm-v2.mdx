## Navigating DAMM v2 pools

DAMM v2, or Dynamic Automated Market Maker v2, builds upon the original DAMM, to provide a powerful, yet hassle-free way to add liquidity and earn fees on Solana. 

[DAMM v2](https://meteoraag.medium.com/dynamic-amm-v2-helping-lps-and-launches-win-c56128c883ad) allows you to deposit tokens into a pool, which are then used as liquidity for traders, bots, and aggregators to swap tokens, earning you fees with every trade. But it is much more configurable than your typical AMM, with features tailored for a wide variety of liquidity providers, token launches, and launchpads.

**Features for LPs include:**

**LPs also have:**

  <Card title="Transfer LP Position via NFT" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left" iconType="solid">
    Effortlessly transfer your liquidity position to another person by simply sending the NFT that represents your LP position.

</CardGroup>

**Token creators can even:**

  <Card title="Launch With a Single Token" icon="arrow-up-right-dots" iconType="solid">
    Launch a new pool using just your token, without needing USDC or other stablecoins.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Custom Trading Start Time" icon="clock" iconType="solid">
    Set a specific future time when pool trading should be enabled, allowing for launches, announcements, or fair trading starts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Concentrated Liquidity Ranges" icon="sliders" iconType="solid">
    Open a pool with a fixed price range to provide higher capital efficiency, similar to Uniswap v3-style concentrated liquidity.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

On the Pool List page, once you’ve selected the token pair and DAMM v2 pool you’d like to add liquidity into, click on it and you would enter the specific pool’s detail page.

To illustrate the various features of DAMM v2, we will be referring to a few pools in this guide, for example [SOL-USDC](https://app.meteora.ag/dammv2/8Pm2kZpnxD3hoMmt4bjStX2Pw2Z9abpbHzZxMPqxPmie), [URANUS-USDC](https://app.meteora.ag/dammv2/7ccKzmrXBpFHwyZGPqPuKL6bEyWAETSnHwnWe3jEneVc), [WLFI-USD1](https://app.meteora.ag/dammv2/F6L1RKAKwNuWwyCwweja6uxAkRv41XFTRWmg8tKGkn83), and [ICM-SOL](https://app.meteora.ag/dammv2/FLuXAxxqMbLkKHWHHCAiX2ub8qZuoC9bb35bSRDNDMo2).

### Total Value Locked 

At the top left of the pool detail page, you can view the pool’s TVL (Total Value Locked). This is the total amount of token assets in the pool in terms of $USD value (how much all the tokens currently in the pool are worth). DAMM v2 allows both permanent and non-permanent locking of liquidity, and the TVL section would show the following:
- Vested Liquidity: % of liquidity non-permanently locked for at least 3 months (at this point in time)
- Permanently Locked Liquidity: % of liquidity permanently locked in the pool

Here's a screenshot of this example pool:
