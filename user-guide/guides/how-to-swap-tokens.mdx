title: How to Swap Tokens on Meteora
description: User Guide
---

If you find yourself in a position where you lack one or both of the tokens required to add liquidity to a pool, you can swap tokens on Meteora using one of these methods:

## Jupiter Terminal

Meteora has integrated [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/) - the most popular DEX aggregator - to help you swap at the best rates. This is done through Jupiter Terminal, which is an open-sourced, lite version of Jupiter that provides end-to-end swap flow by linking it in a site's HTML.

When you are navigating through Meteora, you can access Jupiter Terminal by selecting the Jupiter Terminal icon at the bottom left of the screen. You will see a pop-up where you can connect your wallet (this connects automatically if you're connected on Meteora), select your input and output tokens, and execute your swap.

## Swapping within the pool

When you already possess one of the tokens in an asset pair for a pool, you can also swap some amounts of that token to the other directly using the existing pool liquidity. DLMM, DAMM v2, and DAMM v1, all have a “Swap” tab to swap tokens directly within the pool.

For example, if you want to add liquidity to a SOL/USDC pool, but you only have SOL, you can simply select the "Swap" tab on the pool page to swap a portion your total SOL to an equivalent value of USDC (based on the current pool price of the token). Before you swap through that specific pool, please check that the pool has sufficient liquidity and the current pool price of the token is in sync with the market price.

In addition, check that you are comfortable with the settings (e.g. transaction fees, your preferred slippage) of that pool, and check that the “Swap info” section is acceptable before you execute your transaction.

### How is "Price Impact" on the UI calculated for a swap that occurs through a pool?

Price Impact is the % difference between the value of your input amount and the value of your output amount. 

<Note>
    On the Meteora user interface, Price Impact %:
    - Does not take slippage into account for the swap output amount, so you'll have to set slippage rate to 0 before calculating if you want a more precise %.
    - Does not take into account that the dollar value in the swap input box is sourced from Jupiter's price API, so it may not always be 100% accurate. For example: sometimes USDC will be worth $0.9999
    - Does not take into account the Swap fee that's charged on the swap.
