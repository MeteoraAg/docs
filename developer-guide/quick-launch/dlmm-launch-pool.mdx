# What You'll Achieve

By the end of this quicklaunch, you’ll have built a liquidity pool on Meteora by:
- Configuring your liquidity pool settings
- Interacting with our DLMM program
- See your liquidity pool in action on Meteora

<Tip>
**Why Meteora?**

Meteora is a hyper optimized liquidity layer that ensures that your project's provided liquidity is secure, sustainable and composable for anyone to trade on. By following this guide, you'll be able to launch a concentrated liquidity pool with dynamic fees on Meteora in just a few quick and easy steps.
</Tip>

# Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- pnpm >= 10.0.0

*If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it by running the following command.*

```bash Terminal
npm install -g pnpm
```

# Setup -> Configure -> Launch DLMM Pool

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone and Setup Meteora Invent">
  Meteora Invent is a toolkit consisting of everything you need to invent innovative token launches on Meteora. Run the following command in your terminal to get started.

  ```bash Terminal
  git clone https://github.com/MeteoraAg/metera-invent.git
  ```

  Once you've cloned the repository, you'll have a new project directory with a meteora-invent folder. Run the following to install pnpm and the project dependencies. 

  ```bash Terminal
  cd meteora-invent
  pnpm install
  ```

  </Step>
   <Step title="Optional: Start a Local Test Validator">
    In Meteora Invent we provide an optional command for you to run a local validator to test your pool before deploying it to devnet or mainnet. Run the following command in your code editor terminal to get started.

    ```bash Terminal
    pnpm studio start-test-validator
    ```

    This will start a local validator on your machine which will be hosted on `http://localhost:8899`. <br /> <br />

    </Frame>

    </Step>
  <Step title="Setup Environment Variables">
  We provide an easy way to setup environment variables when getting started. Run the following command in your code editor terminal to get started.

  ```bash Terminal
  cp studio/.env.example studio/.env
  ```

  This will copy the example environment variables file to your `.env` file. Configure the following variables:

  - `PRIVATE_KEY` - Your private key for the wallet you will be using to deploy the pool.

  Therafter, you will need to run this command to generate a keypair from your wallet private key.

  ```bash Terminal
    # For devnet (airdrops 5 SOL)
    pnpm studio generate-keypair --network devnet

    # For localnet (airdrops 5 SOL)
    # Ensure that you have already started the local validator with pnpm start-test-validator
    pnpm studio generate-keypair --network localnet
    ```

  This will generate a `keypair.json` file in the `studio` directory which will be used for all actions in this guide. <br /> <br />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your DLMM Pool">
  Navigate to the `studio/config/dlmm_config.jsonc` file and configure your DLMM pool settings. <br /> <br />

  <Accordion title="Set your DLMM configuration">
  Your can configure everything DLMM pool related in this file.

  <Note>The comments in the file are to help you understand the different settings you can configure. Please ensure that you read through the comments while configuring your pool.</Note>

  <Tip>
  The toolkit contains logic to make it easier for you to create the DLMM pool such as:

  - Minting a new `baseMint` token or parsing in an existing `baseMint` token.
  - Launching the DLMM pool immediately or at a certain `activationPoint` (in slots or timestamp depending on the `activationType`).
  - Optional creation of an Alpha Vault with your DLMM launch pool.
  </Tip>


  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your DLMM Pool">
  After configuring your DLMM pool settings in `dlmm_config.jsonc`, you can now create your pool by running the following command.

  ```bash Terminal
  pnpm studio dlmm-create-pool --config ./studio/config/dlmm_config.jsonc
  ```

  This will create your pool and print the pool address and other relevant information to the console. <br /> <br />

  </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Seed your DLMM Pool">
  After creating your DLMM pool, you can now seed your pool with liquidity. <br /> <br />

  *If you want to seed your pool with liquidity using the LFG model, you can run the following command.*

  <Warning>Please take note that the `dlmm-seed-liquidity-lfg` command will only work when your DLMM launch pool is not activated yet. You can configure the pool activation time using the `activationPoint` parameter in the `dlmm_config.jsonc` file.</Warning>

  ```bash Terminal
  pnpm studio dlmm-seed-liquidity-lfg --config ./studio/config/dlmm_config.jsonc
  ```

  This will seed your DLMM pool with liquidity based on the `curvature`, `minPrice` and `maxPrice` parameters that you have set in the `dlmm_config.jsonc` file.

  <Note>If you want to learn how the liquidity curvature works,   you can head to https://ilm.jup.ag/ to learn more.</Note>

  *If you want to seed your pool with liquidity in a single bin, you can run the following command.*

  <Warning>Please take note that the `dlmm-seed-liquidity-single-bin` command will only work when your DLMM launch pool is not activated yet. You can configure the pool activation time using the `activationPoint` parameter in the `dlmm_config.jsonc` file.</Warning>

  ```bash Terminal
  pnpm studio dlmm-seed-liquidity-single-bin --config ./studio/config/dlmm_config.jsonc
  ```

  This will seed your DLMM pool with liquidity in a single bin based on the `price` and `seedAmount` parameters that you have set in the `dlmm_config.jsonc` file. <br /> <br />

   <img src="/images/developer-guide/dlmm-seed-liquidity-single-bin.png" />

  </Step>
</Steps>

Voilà! You've successfully created your DLMM pool on Meteora. You can now see your pool in action on Meteora either on Meteora's [mainnet](https://app.meteora.ag) or [devnet](https://devnet.meteora.ag) app.
