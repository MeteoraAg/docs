# What You'll Achieve

By the end of this quicklaunch, you’ll have built a liquidity pool on Meteora by:
- Configuring your liquidity pool settings
- Interacting with our DAMM v2 program
- See your liquidity pool in action on Meteora

<Tip>
**Why Meteora?**

Meteora is a hyper optimized liquidity layer that ensures that your project's provided liquidity is secure, sustainable and composable for anyone to trade on. By following this guide, you'll be able to launch a balanced / concentrated / one-sided liquidity pool with dynamic fees on Meteora in just a few quick and easy steps.
</Tip>

# Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- pnpm >= 10.0.0

*If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it by running the following command.*

```bash Terminal
npm install -g pnpm
```

# Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone and Setup Meteora Invent">
  Meteora Invent is a toolkit consisting of everything you need to invent innovative token launches on Meteora. Run the following command in your terminal to get started.

  ```bash Terminal
  git clone https://github.com/MeteoraAg/meteora-invent.git
  ```

  Once you've cloned the repository, you'll have a new project directory with a meteora-invent folder. Run the following to install pnpm and the project dependencies. 

  ```bash Terminal
  cd meteora-invent
  pnpm install
  ```

  </Frame>

  </Step>
   <Step title="Optional: Start a Local Test Validator">
    In Meteora Invent we provide an optional command for you to run a local validator to test your pool before deploying it to devnet or mainnet. Run the following command in your code editor terminal to get started.

    ```bash Terminal
    pnpm studio start-test-validator
    ```

    This will start a local validator on your machine which will be hosted on `http://localhost:8899`. <br /> <br />
    
    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/developer-guide/start-test-validator.webp" />
    </Frame>

    </Step>
  <Step title="Setup Environment Variables">
  We provide an easy way to setup environment variables when getting started. Run the following command in your code editor terminal to get started.

  ```bash Terminal
  cp studio/.env.example studio/.env
  ```

  This will copy the example environment variables file to your `.env` file. Configure the following variables:

  - `PRIVATE_KEY` - Your private key for the wallet you will be using to deploy the pool.

  Therafter, you will need to run this command to generate a keypair from your wallet private key.

  ```bash Terminal
  pnpm studio generate-keypair

  # For devnet (airdrops 5 SOL)
  pnpm studio generate-keypair --network devnet --airdrop

  # For localnet (airdrops 5 SOL)
  # Ensure that you have already started the local validator with pnpm start-test-validator
  pnpm studio generate-keypair --network localnet --airdrop
  ```

  This will generate a `keypair.json` file in the `studio` directory which will be used for all actions in this guide. <br /> <br />

  </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your DAMM v2 Pool">
  Navigate to the `studio/config/damm_v2_config.jsonc` file and configure your DAMM v2 pool settings. <br /> <br />

  <Accordion title="Set your DAMM v2 configuration">
  Your can configure everything DAMM v2 pool related in this file.

  <Note>The comments in the file are to help you understand the different settings you can configure. Please ensure that you read through the comments while configuring your pool.</Note>

    <Tip>
        The toolkit contains logic to make it easier for you to create the DAMM v2 pool such as:

        - Minting a new `baseMint` token or parsing in an existing `baseMint` token.
        - Launching the DAMM v2 pool immediately or at a certain `activationPoint` (in slots or timestamp depending on the `activationType`).
        - Fully customizable pool fees (including fee scheduler and dynamic fee settings).
        - Optional creation of an Alpha Vault with your DAMM v2 launch pool.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your DAMM v2 Pool">
  After configuring your DAMM v2 pool settings in `damm_v2_config.jsonc`, you can now create your pool by running the following command.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="damm-v2-create-balanced-pool" icon="scale-balanced">
        _If you don't have a base mint, you can configure `createBaseToken` in the config file and run the
        following command._

        ```bash
        pnpm studio damm-v2-create-balanced-pool
        ```

        _If you already have a base mint, you can provide it via the CLI with a `--baseMint` flag and run
        the following command._

        ```bash
        pnpm studio damm-v2-create-balanced-pool --baseMint <YOUR_BASE_MINT_ADDRESS>
        ```

        <Note>Creating a balanced pool will require the `quoteAmount` to be set in the `damm_v2_config.jsonc` file.</Note>

        pnpm studio damm-v2-create-one-sided-pool --baseMint <YOUR_BASE_MINT_ADDRESS>
        ```

        This will create your pool with liqudity deposited from your `keypair.json` and print the pool address and other relevant information to the console. <br /> <br />

Voilà! You've successfully created your DAMM v2 pool on Meteora. You can now see your pool in action on Meteora either on Meteora's [mainnet](https://app.meteora.ag) or [devnet](https://devnet.meteora.ag) app.
