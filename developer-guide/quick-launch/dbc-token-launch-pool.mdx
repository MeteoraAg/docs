title: DBC Token Launch Pool
description: Configure and Launch a DBC Token Pool on Meteora using nothing but a configuration file and a few CLI commands
---

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to create a DBC token launch pool on Meteora. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting out, this guide has got you covered to deploy liquidity and launch your project on Meteora.

# What You'll Achieve

By the end of this quicklaunch, you’ll have built a liquidity pool on Meteora by:
- Configuring your bonding curve pool and graduated DAMM v1/v2 pool settings
- Interacting with our Dynamic Bonding Curve program
- See your token tradeable across all trading terminals e.g. Jupiter Pro, Axiom, Photon etc.

<Tip>
**Why Meteora?**

Meteora is a hyper optimized liquidity layer that ensures that your project's provided liquidity is secure, sustainable and composable for anyone to trade on. By following this guide, you'll be able to launch a bonding curve config and a token pool using the bonding curve config on Meteora in just a few quick and easy steps.
</Tip>

# Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- pnpm >= 10.0.0

*If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it by running the following command.*

```bash Terminal
npm install -g pnpm
```


# Setup -> Configure -> Launch DBC Token Pool

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone and Setup Meteora Invent">
  Meteora Invent is a toolkit consisting of everything you need to invent innovative token launches on Meteora. Run the following command in your terminal to get started.

  ```bash Terminal
  git clone https://github.com/MeteoraAg/metera-invent.git
  ```

  Once you've cloned the repository, you'll have a new project directory with a meteora-invent folder. Run the following to install pnpm and the project dependencies. 

  ```bash Terminal
  pnpm install
  ```

  </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup Environment Variables">
  We provide an easy way to setup environment variables when getting started. Run the following command in your code editor terminal to get started.

  ```bash Terminal
  cp studio/.env.example studio/.env
  ```

  This will copy the example environment variables file to your `.env` file. Configure the following variables:

  - `PRIVATE_KEY` - Your private key for the wallet you will be using to deploy the pool.

  Therafter, you will need to run this command to generate a keypair from your wallet private key.

  ```bash Terminal
  pnpm studio generate-keypair
  ```

  This will generate a `keypair.json` file in the `studio` directory which will be used for all actions in this guide. <br /> <br />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Optional: Start a Local Test Validator">
  In Meteora Invent we provide an optional command for you to run a local validator to test your pool before deploying it to devnet or mainnet. Run the following command in your code editor terminal to get started.

  ```bash Terminal
  pnpm studio start-test-validator
  ```

  This will start a local validator on your machine which will be hosted on `http://localhost:8899`. <br /> <br />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your DBC Token Pool">
  Navigate to the `studio/config/dbc_config.jsonc` file and configure your DBC token pool settings. <br /> <br />

  <Accordion title="Set your DBC configuration">
  Your can configure everything DBC token pool related in this file.

  <Note> The comments in the file are to help you understand the different settings you can configure. Please ensure that you read through the comments while configuring your pool.</Note>

  ```
  <Note>
    Creating a DBC token pool will automatically mint the token within the same `initialize_virtual_pool`instruction, so if you want to provide a vanity mint address, you will need to specify the `baseMintKeypairFilepath` in the `dbc_config.jsonc` file.
  </Note>

  <Tip>
    The toolkit contains logic to make it easier for you to create the DBC token pool such as:

    - Configuring your bonding curve shape based on your `buildCurveMode`.
    - Launching the DBC config and token pool using the config immediately.
    - Configuring your Anti-Sniping settings (such as Fee Scheduler or Rate Limiter) easily.
    - Abstracts the math behind crafting the bonding curve.
  </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your DBC Token Pool">
  After configuring your DBC token pool settings in `dbc_config.jsonc`, you can now create your token pool by running the following command.

  ```bash Terminal
  pnpm studio dbc-create-pool --config ./studio/config/dbc_config.jsonc
  ```

  This will create your DBC curve config and token pool. You will also be able to see the token address and other relevant information in the console. <br /> <br />

Voilà! You've successfully created your DBC token pool on Meteora. You can now see your token in action on [Jupiter Pro](https://jup.ag/pro), [Axiom](https://axiom.trade/discover) or [Photon](https://photon-sol.tinyastro.io/en/discover).
