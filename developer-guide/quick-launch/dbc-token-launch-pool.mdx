# What You'll Achieve

By the end of this quicklaunch, you’ll have built a liquidity pool on Meteora by:
- Configuring your bonding curve pool and graduated DAMM v1/v2 pool settings
- Interacting with our Dynamic Bonding Curve program
- See your token tradeable across all trading terminals e.g. Jupiter Pro, Axiom, Photon etc.

<Tip>
**Why Meteora?**

Meteora is a hyper optimized liquidity layer that ensures that your project's provided liquidity is secure, sustainable and composable for anyone to trade on. By following this guide, you'll be able to launch a bonding curve config and a token pool using the bonding curve config on Meteora in just a few quick and easy steps.
</Tip>

# Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- pnpm >= 10.0.0

*If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it by running the following command.*

```bash Terminal
npm install -g pnpm
```


# Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone and Setup Meteora Invent">
  Meteora Invent is a toolkit consisting of everything you need to invent innovative token launches on Meteora. Run the following command in your terminal to get started.

  ```bash Terminal
  git clone https://github.com/MeteoraAg/meteora-invent.git
  ```

  Once you've cloned the repository, you'll have a new project directory with a meteora-invent folder. Run the following to install pnpm and the project dependencies. 

  ```bash Terminal
  cd meteora-invent
  pnpm install
  ```

  </Frame>

  </Step>
   <Step title="Optional: Start a Local Test Validator">
    In Meteora Invent we provide an optional command for you to run a local validator to test your pool before deploying it to devnet or mainnet. Run the following command in your code editor terminal to get started.

    ```bash Terminal
    pnpm studio start-test-validator
    ```

    This will start a local validator on your machine which will be hosted on `http://localhost:8899`. <br /> <br />

    </Frame>

    </Step>
  <Step title="Setup Environment Variables">
  We provide an easy way to setup environment variables when getting started. Run the following command in your code editor terminal to get started.

  ```bash Terminal
  cp studio/.env.example studio/.env
  ```

  This will copy the example environment variables file to your `.env` file. Configure the following variables:

  - `PRIVATE_KEY` - Your private key for the wallet you will be using to deploy the pool.

  Therafter, you will need to run this command to generate a keypair from your wallet private key.

  ```bash Terminal
  pnpm studio generate-keypair

  # For devnet (airdrops 5 SOL)
  pnpm studio generate-keypair --network devnet --airdrop

  # For localnet (airdrops 5 SOL)
  # Ensure that you have already started the local validator with pnpm start-test-validator
  pnpm studio generate-keypair --network localnet --airdrop
  ```

  This will generate a `keypair.json` file in the `studio` directory which will be used for all actions in this guide. <br /> <br />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your DBC Token Pool">
  Navigate to the `studio/config/dbc_config.jsonc` file and configure your DBC token pool settings. <br /> <br />

  <Accordion title="Set your DBC configuration">
  Your can configure everything DBC token pool related in this file.

  <Note> The comments in the file are to help you understand the different settings you can configure. Please ensure that you read through the comments while configuring your pool.</Note>

  ```
  <Note>
    Creating a DBC token pool will automatically mint the token within the same `initialize_virtual_pool`instruction, so if you want to provide a vanity mint address, you will need to specify the `baseMintKeypairFilepath` in the `dbc_config.jsonc` file.
  </Note>

  <Tip>
    The toolkit contains logic to make it easier for you to create the DBC token pool such as:

    - Configuring your bonding curve shape based on your `buildCurveMode`.
    - Launching the DBC config and token pool using the config immediately.
    - Configuring your Anti-Sniping settings (such as Fee Scheduler or Rate Limiter) easily.
    - Abstracts the math behind crafting the bonding curve.
  </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your DBC Token Pool">
  After configuring your DBC token pool settings in `dbc_config.jsonc`, you can now create your token pool by running the following command.

  _If you don't have a DBC config key, you can run the following command and the config key + pool
  will be created together._

  ```bash
  pnpm studio dbc-create-pool
  ```

  _If you already have an existing DBC config key, you can provide it via the CLI with a `--config`
  flag and run the following command._

  ```bash
  pnpm studio dbc-create-pool --config <YOUR_DBC_CONFIG_KEY>
  ```

  This will create your DBC curve config (if there is no config key) and token pool. You will also be able to see the token address and other relevant information in the console. <br /> <br />

Voilà! You've successfully created your DBC token pool on Meteora. You can now see your token in action on [Jupiter Pro](https://jup.ag/pro), [Axiom](https://axiom.trade/discover) or [Photon](https://photon-sol.tinyastro.io/en/discover).
