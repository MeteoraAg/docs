# Features

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Staking System for Fee Distribution" icon="coins" iconType="solid">
    Users can stake meme tokens to earn trading fees from a DAMM v1 pool. Only the top stakers (configurable number) receive fee distributions. The program maintains a top staker list and a full balance list to track all participants.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Vault Initialization" icon="vault" iconType="solid">
    Creates a vault associated with a specific AMM pool (Dynamic AMM) with configurable parameters:
    - `top_list_length`: Number of top holders who receive fees (min: 10, max: 300)
    - `seconds_to_full_unlock`: Time for locked fees to be fully distributed (min: 60s, max: 30 days)
    - `unstake_lock_duration`: Lock period for unstaking (min: 1 hour, max: 30 days)
    - `start_fee_distribute_timestamp`: When fee distribution begins
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Staking Operations" icon="layer-group" iconType="solid">
    - **Stake**: Users deposit meme tokens to participate in fee sharing
    - **Initialize Stake Escrow**: Creates an escrow account for each staker

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Fee Claiming Mechanism" icon="hand-holding-dollar" iconType="solid">
    Claims fees from the associated DAMM v1 pool with:
    - **Dual token fees**: Supports both base (meme) and quote (SOL/USDC) tokens
    - **Auto-restaking**: Claimed meme tokens are automatically restaked
    - **Quote token withdrawal**: Only quote tokens (SOL/USDC) are sent to users
    - Fees distributed proportionally based on stake amount among top holders
    - Time-locked fee release mechanism for gradual distribution
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Unstaking Process" icon="clock" iconType="solid">
    - **Request Unstake**: Initiates unstaking with a lock period
    - **Cancel Unstake**: Allows cancellation before the lock period ends

    - Automatically updates the top staker list when stakes change
    - Tracks whether a staker is in the top list (in_top_list flag)
    - Adjusts fee distribution checkpoints when users enter/exit the top list
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Fee Distribution Algorithm" icon="calculator" iconType="solid">
    - Uses a checkpoint system with cumulative fee per liquidity
    - Calculates pending fees based on stake amount and time in the top list
    - Supports gradual fee release over `seconds_to_full_unlock` period
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Permissionless" icon="users-gear" iconType="solid">
