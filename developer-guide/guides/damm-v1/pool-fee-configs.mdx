# How to Choose a Suitable Pool Config

What fee parameters to choose depends on your project's needs. You will need to look at the pool [config list](https://damm-api.meteora.ag/swagger-ui/#/pools/get_all_pool_configs) and choose a suitable `pool_config_key` with your preferred fee parameters.

If you want to create an Alpha Vault along with your new pool, you also need to find a `pool_config_key` that is mapped to a `vault_config_key` that meets your requirements. You can find the list of alpha vault configs [here](https://damm-api.meteora.ag/swagger-ui/#/alpha_vault_config/get_all).

- Using these endpoint, pool creators can input the config pubkey, and it will return an array of fee update timings for the config.

- Pool creators may choose a `pool_config_key` with a fee curve that suits your integration.

If there is no existing config in the list that fits your project's requirement, a new config needs to be created.

<Note>Only the Meteora team can create a new config to add it to the preset pool config list.</Note>

# Default Pool Config Used by Meteora Frontend

By default, Meteora's frontend is currently using this pool config key for Memecoin Pool creation: 

```
FiENCCbPi3rFh5pW2AJ59HC53yM32eLaCjMKxRqanKFJ
```

For the `FiENCCbPi3rFh5pW2AJ59HC53yM32eLaCjMKxRqanKFJ` pool config, it doesn't allow creation of any Alpha Vault, therefore its field `vault_config_key` is `1111111...`

# New Custom Pool Config and Fee Curve for Pool Creators

## Custom Pool Config Key

Pool creators may need to use their own unique custom pool config key, if they want custom `pool_creator_authority` to prevent front-running of the token launch pool.

<Note>New dedicated config keys can only be created by Meteora. Please reach out to us if this is required.</Note>

<Warning>The `pool_creator_authority` doesn't work with program address. It's not a program whitelist, it needs to be a PDA (program derived address) or normal account.</Warning>


## Custom Fee Curve

Meteora can also apply a custom fee curve/schedule for your pools, but we will need to create a dedicated config key for your team, where `pool_creator_authority` is linked to your signer wallet for pool creation. 

<Note>You would need to send us your **signer wallet** that would be using to deploy the pools.</Note>

<Warning>Even with a dedicated config key for your team, Meteora would need to customize the fee curve/schedule for you. You can't do it on your own.</Warning>

# Custom Fee Curve for a Specific Pool

If required, Meteora can set a custom fee curve for a single, specific pool which would override the fee curve used by the pool's config key regardless of which config key is used.

# API to Track Associated Fee Curve for Each Config

Using this endpoint, pool creators can input the config pubkey, and it will return an array of fee update timings for the config. Pool creators may then choose a config with a fee curve that suits their integration.

## Steps to Check Fee Curves

<Steps>
  <Step title="View All Pool Configs">
    Navigate to [Swagger UI](https://damm-api.meteora.ag/swagger-ui/#/pools/get_all_pool_configs)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Config">
    Press **"Execute"** and find and select the config you want to view
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Dynamic Fee Curve">
    [Check](https://damm-api.meteora.ag/swagger-ui/#/fee_config/get_config_associated_fee_configs) for any Dynamic Fee curve for that specific config
  </Step>

# Understanding Pool Config Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `config_address` | The pool config key |
| `trade_fee_bps` | Pool trading fee |
| `protocol_fee_bps` | Protocol fee charged from pool trading fee |
| `activation_duration` | Used to determine when exactly the pool will start trading |
| `vault_config_key` | Alpha vault config key. If it is `11111111111111111111111111111111`, means no alpha vault. If not, the pool can create an alpha vault. **Note:** This is NOT the same as the vault address. |
| `pool_creator_authority` | Address which can use the pool config key to create a pool. If it is `11111111111111111111111111111111`, it's public and available for everyone to use |
| `activation_type` | Pool activation type. `0` = slot, `1` = time |

**Start trade time calculation**
- `current_time + activation_duration` OR
- `current_slot + activation_duration` (depends on the `activation_type`)

# Pool Config Example

```json
{
  "config_address": "FiENCCbPi3rFh5pW2AJ59HC53yM32eLaCjMKxRqanKFJ",
  "trade_fee_bps": 1500,
  "protocol_fee_bps": 2000,
  "activation_duration": 0,
  "vault_config_key": "11111111111111111111111111111111",
  "pool_creator_authority": "11111111111111111111111111111111",
  "activation_type": 0
}
```

# User Flow Example

A pool config may or may not have an associated vault config. There's no vault config associated when the `vault_config_key` is `11111111111111111111111111111111`.

When the pool config has a vault config, user can create the pool + Alpha Vault that is binded (auto-whitelisted) by the pool. The Alpha Vault created will inherit the parameters (Pro Rata / FCFS + buying_cap, vesting duration, etc.) from the vault config.

## Creating Pool ABC/SOL with an Alpha Vault

Let's say a user wants to create the pool ABC/SOL with an Alpha Vault, the user will need to:

1. **Check for pool config** that have `vault_config_key` not = `1111...`, and `pool_creator_authority` is the user or `1111...` (accessible by the public)

2. **Based on the vault requirement** the user wants, the user will need to:
   - a) Check all the pool configs from step 1, which are each mapped to a `vault_config_key`, as well as
   - b) Check for vault config and look for one that fits the requirement

3. **If the user finds a requirement** that suits their needs, they can use that `pool_config_key` to create the pool, then use the pool config-mapped `vault_config_key` to create the vault. As long as `vault_config_key` is used, the vault is automatically whitelisted upon pool creation.

All the settings are already predefined by `pool_config` + its mapped `vault_config_key`.

<Note>The permutations for pool config + Alpha Vault are created by Meteora.</Note>

## Pool Config Example

```json
{
  "config_address": "8aPHoLN8ke6PhWeYA7ELi19fppptVYUCQvqKWR5yP1sn",
  "trade_fee_bps": 150,
  "protocol_fee_bps": 2000,
  "activation_duration": 1512000,
  "vault_config_key": "7ixojP8Zuu4csfTycHi8ywQymHm9zxAhu1TjnFuJaq2R",
  "pool_creator_authority": "5unTfT2kssBuNvHPY6LbJfJpLqEcdMxGYLWHwShaeTLi",
  "activation_type": 0
}
```

### Alpha Vault Config Example

```json
{
  "address": "7ixojP8Zuu4csfTycHi8ywQymHm9zxAhu1TjnFuJaq2R",
  "max_depositing_cap": 10,
  "start_vesting_duration": 1,
  "end_vesting_duration": 24107,
  "depositing_duration_until_last_join_point": 24107,
  "individual_depositing_cap": 1,
  "escrow_fee": 0,
  "activation_type": 0
}
```

In this example above, only the `pool_creator_authority` => `5unTfT2kssBuNvHPY6LbJfJpLqEcdMxGYLWHwShaeTLi` can use the pool config `8aPHoLN8ke6PhWeYA7ELi19fppptVYUCQvqKWR5yP1sn` to create a pool with the below settings:

- **1.5% fee**
- **20% protocol fee** (this is fixed Meteora fee)
- Pool starts trading after **1512000 slot** upon creation
- **Slot based activation**

You can also create a binded Alpha Vault with **FCFS config** as shown below:

- Max deposit cap = **10 token**
- Vested over **24106 slot** after pool activate
- Deposit opens at **24107 slot** before vault crank
- Every escrow maximum can only deposit **1 token**
