title: "DLMM Launch Pools Overview"
---

DLMM Launch Pool is a pool type designed for new token launches. It comes fundamentally equipped with a feature set that makes it optimal for bootstrapping liquidity for new tokens and making the tokens accessible on Jupiter and other trading integrations.

The Launch Pool has some differences from a standard DLMM Pool (e.g. those created via the Meteora UI). Its setup builds upon the standard DLMM pool tech and features to provide the following benefits:

Customisable DLMM pool to suit different project needs; design your liquidity distribution curve and other parameters using the [ILM curve tool](https://ilm.jup.ag) at launch.

Ability to set your activation point (token launch timing).

Single-sided bootstrapping of liquidity using project tokens, without the need for initial USDC or SOL capital

Token immediately tradable on Jupiter (Swap, DCA, LO) and all Jupiter integrations at launch, including Phantom, Solflare, and Birdeye, and popular trading bots

Concentrated liquidity with zero-slippage bins and Dynamic Fees (average 6-7% for launch pools)

## Who should use DLMM Launch Pool?

The Launch Pool is targeted at new projects and token creators on Solana looking for a customizable liquidity pool setup to bootstrap liquidity for their new token and help ensure widespread token accessibility and distribution.

The aim is for projects to bootstrap liquidity on their terms, with the flexibility to set their preferred price curve, liquidity distribution, and launch parameters exactly the way they want. This is also the same underlying technology used by Jupiter LFG Launchpad.

Anyone can use our docs to create their own permissionless Launch Pool to be used for their token launch.

## Checklist

### Liquidity Distribution parameters

Use the [ILM (Intuitive Liquidity Modelling)](https://ilm.jup.ag/) tool to design the liquidity distribution for your pool and decide on your final parameters.

- Curvature: Determines how liquidity is distributed across the price range

- Initial Price: Initial price for the token at the start of the launch

- Maximum Price: Maximum price for the token during the launch

- Percentage of Total Supply in the pool

- Total Supply of the Token (in Millions)

- Bin Step: Determines the granularity of the price by changing the number of price bins available. Each bin represents a single price point, and the difference between 2 consecutive bins is the bin step. Bin steps are calculated based on basis points.

- Base Fee: The minimum fee charged per swap in the pool.
