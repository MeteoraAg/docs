# Features

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Dynamic Fee Vault Creation" icon="vault" iconType="solid">
    **Two initialization methods:**
    - `initialize_fee_vault`: Creates a fee vault with a signer keypair
    - `initialize_fee_vault_pda`: Creates a fee vault using PDA for deterministic addresses
    
    **Multi-user support:** Supports 2-5 users per vault (configurable via MAX_USER constant)
    
    **Token compatibility:** Supports both SPL Token and Token-2022 standards
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Proportional Fee Distribution System" icon="chart-pie" iconType="solid">
    **Share-based allocation:** Each user has a defined share amount that determines their portion of fees
    
    **Precision calculations:** Uses 52-bit precision scaling for accurate fee distribution math
    
    **Dynamic fee accumulation:** Tracks `fee_per_share` to calculate individual user rewards over time
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Fee Funding Mechanism" icon="money-bill-wave" iconType="solid">
    **Flexible funding:** Anyone can fund fees into the vault via `fund_fee` instruction
    
    **Transfer fee handling:** Automatically accounts for token transfer fees (important for Token-2022)
    
    **Amount validation:** Ensures funded amounts are greater than zero
    
    **Real-time distribution:** Fees are immediately distributed proportionally to all users
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Individual Fee Claiming" icon="hand-holding-dollar" iconType="solid">
    **Index-based claiming:** Users claim fees using their assigned index (0-4)
    
    **Authorization:** Only the designated user can claim their fees
    
    **Checkpoint system:** Tracks `fee_per_share_checkpoint` to calculate unclaimed rewards
    
    **Accumulated tracking:** Maintains running total of claimed fees per user
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Token Management" icon="coins" iconType="solid">
    **Vault authority:** Uses PDA-based authority for secure token operations
    
    **Token vault:** Dedicated token account for holding fees
    
    **Multi-token support:** Each vault is tied to a specific token mint
    
    **Transfer utilities:** Includes helper functions for token transfers
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Security & Validation Features" icon="shield-check" iconType="solid">
    **Ownership controls:** Each vault has a designated owner
    
    **User validation:** Validates user addresses and share amounts during initialization
    
    **Index bounds checking:** Prevents out-of-bounds access to user array
    
    **Math overflow protection:** Safe math operations throughout
    
    **Mint verification:** Ensures only supported token mints can be used
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Event Logging" icon="list" iconType="solid">
    **Initialization events:** Logs vault creation with all parameters
    
    **Funding events:** Tracks fee funding activities with amounts and funders
    
    **Claiming events:** Records fee claims with user details and amounts
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Flexible Architecture" icon="cubes" iconType="solid">
    **Zero-copy accounts:** Efficient memory usage with zero-copy account structures
    
    **Modular design:** Well-organized instruction handlers and utilities
    
    **Future extensibility:** Built-in padding fields for future feature additions
