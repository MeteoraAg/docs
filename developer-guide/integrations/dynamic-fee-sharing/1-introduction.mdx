# Features

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Dynamic Fee Vault Creation" icon="vault" iconType="solid">
    **Two initialization methods:**
    - `initialize_fee_vault`: Creates a fee vault with a signer keypair
    - `initialize_fee_vault_pda`: Creates a fee vault using PDA for deterministic addresses
    
    **Multi-user support:** Supports 2-5 users per vault (configurable via MAX_USER constant)
    
    **Token compatibility:** Supports both SPL Token and Token-2022 standards
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Proportional Fee Distribution System" icon="chart-pie" iconType="solid">
    **Share-based allocation:** Each user has a defined share amount that determines their portion of fees
    
    **Precision calculations:** Uses 52-bit precision scaling for accurate fee distribution math
    
    **Dynamic fee accumulation:** Tracks `fee_per_share` to calculate individual user rewards over time
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Fee Funding Mechanism" icon="money-bill-wave" iconType="solid">
    **Flexible funding:** Anyone can fund fees into the vault via `fund_fee` instruction
    
    **Transfer fee handling:** Automatically accounts for token transfer fees (important for Token-2022)
    
    **Amount validation:** Ensures funded amounts are greater than zero
    
    **Real-time distribution:** Fees are immediately distributed proportionally to all users
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Individual Fee Claiming" icon="hand-holding-dollar" iconType="solid">
    **Index-based claiming:** Users claim fees using their assigned index (0-4)
    
    **Authorization:** Only the designated user can claim their fees
    
    **Checkpoint system:** Tracks `fee_per_share_checkpoint` to calculate unclaimed rewards
    
    **Accumulated tracking:** Maintains running total of claimed fees per user
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Token Management" icon="coins" iconType="solid">
    **Vault authority:** Uses PDA-based authority for secure token operations
    
    **Token vault:** Dedicated token account for holding fees
    
    **Multi-token support:** Each vault is tied to a specific token mint
    
    **Transfer utilities:** Includes helper functions for token transfers
