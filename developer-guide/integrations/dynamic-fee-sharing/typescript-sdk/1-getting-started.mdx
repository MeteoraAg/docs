This guide provides instructions on how to get started with the Dynamic Fee Sharing TypeScript SDK.

Before you begin, here are some important resources:

-   **Program ID (Mainnet & Devnet):** `dfsdo2UqvwfN8DuUVrMRNfQe11VaiNoKcMqLHVvDPzh`
-   **TypeScript SDK Repository:** [@meteora-ag/dynamic-fee-sharing-sdk](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-fee-sharing-sdk)

# Installation

To use the SDK in your project, install it using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install @meteora-ag/dynamic-fee-sharing-sdk @solana/web3.js
# or
pnpm install @meteora-ag/dynamic-fee-sharing-sdk @solana/web3.js
# or
yarn add @meteora-ag/dynamic-fee-sharing-sdk @solana/web3.js
```

# Initialization

Once installed, you can initialize the SDK in your TypeScript/JavaScript project like this:

```typescript
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { DynamicFeeSharingClient } from "@meteora-ag/dynamic-fee-sharing-sdk";

// Initialize a connection to the Solana network (e.g., Mainnet)
const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");

// Create a new instance of the DynamicFeeSharingClient
const client = new DynamicFeeSharingClient(connection, "confirmed");
```

# Testing the SDK (for contributors)

If you have cloned the SDK repository and want to run the built-in tests:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run tests
bun test
```
