title: Bonding Curve Formulas
---

The Dynamic Bonding Curve is a customizable bonding curve that allows you to configure up to 16 curve segments to control the curve's shape and price action. Each curve segment follows a constant product formula:

```math
x \times y = k
```

## Mathematical Foundation

A simple constant product formula can be expressed as:

```math
x \times y = \text{Virtual Base Reserve} \times \text{Virtual Curve Reserve}
```

This can also be represented as:

```math
x \times y = \text{Liquidity}^2
```

Where:

```math
\text{Liquidity} = \sqrt{\,\text{Virtual Base Reserve} \times \text{Virtual Curve Reserve}\,}
```

With a constraint on `migration_quote_threshold`, this can be presented as a function of liquidity, minimum price, and maximum price. We denote:
- `l` = liquidity
- `pa` = minimum price  
- `pb` = maximum price

Therefore:

```math
\text{Bonding Curve Constant Product} = f(l, p_a, p_b)
```

### Example Configuration

Consider a pool with the following configuration:

```
sqrt_start_price = 1
curve = [
  (sqrt_price = 2, liquidity = 100),
  (sqrt_price = 4, liquidity = 500)
]
```

The bonding curve will function across 2 price ranges:

- **Range 1**: `(l = 100, pa = 1, pb = 2)`
- **Range 2**: `(l = 500, pa = 2, pb = 4)`

<Note>These are just example values and are not real values in the actual curve. You will have to calculate the actual `sqrt_price` and `liquidity` values which will be much bigger.</Note>

## Core Formulas

Below are the core formulas used in the dynamic bonding curve program. We use the following notation:

- Let $L_i$ = liquidity in $i$ index
- Let $P_i$ = price at $i$ index
- $P_{i-1}$ = price at the lower boundary of $i$ index

### 1. Bonding Curve Amount

The total amount of base mint tokens in the bonding curve is given by:

```math
\text{Bonding Curve Amount} = \sum_{i} L_i \left( \frac{1}{P_{i-1}} - \frac{1}{P_i} \right)
```

---

### 2. Migration Quote Threshold

The migration quote threshold required for the pool to migrate is calculated as:

```math
\text{Migration Quote Threshold} = \sum_{i} L_i (P_i - P_{i-1})
```

---

### 3. Migration Price Calculation

To determine the migration price squared ($p_\text{max}^2$) during migration, use:

```math
p_\text{max}^2 = \frac{\text{Migration Quote Threshold} \times (1 - \text{Migration Fee Percentage})}{\text{Migration Amount}}
```

Where:
- `Migration Fee Percentage` is the fee (as a decimal, e.g., 0.01 for 1%)
- `Migration Amount` is the total amount of base mint tokens being migrated

These formulas allow you to compute swap amounts, migration thresholds, and price limits for any custom liquidity distribution along the bonding curve.
