# Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC)

Build your own fully customizable bonding curve with DBC. DBC allows you to configure everything from the curve shape to the trading fees.

## Flow of DBC Pool -> DAMM Pool

### Concepts 
- Pre-bonding: DBC pool - where the newly minted token discovers its price. No need for an LP.
- Post-bonding: DAMM pool - where the accumulated `quote_mint` tokens in the bonding curve + a portion of the `base_mint` tokens are migrated to form the liquidity pool of the new token
- Partner: Launchpad
- Creator: Token Pool Creator

### Flow
<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Create DBC Config Key">
    Partner creates a DBC Config Key that consists of the curve shape, migrated pool fee, and many more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Create DBC Token Pool">
    Creator creates a DBC Token Pool with the Partner's DBC Config Key. This action will mint the new token and initialise a DBC Pool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Trade DBC Token Pool">
    The DBC Token Pool is tradeable on all trading terminals and trading bots (including Jupiter Pro, Axiom, Photon, GMGN, BullX etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Migrate to DAMM Pool">
    Once the DBC Token Pool has accumulated enough `quote_mint` tokens (`pool_state::quote_reserve >= pool_config::migration_quote_threshold`), our migrator keeper will automatically migrate the DBC pool to a DAMM Pool.
    <Note>The `migration_quote_threshold` and a portion of the `base_mint` tokens will form the liquidity pool of the DAMM Pool.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5: Trade DAMM Pool">
    The DAMM Pool is also tradeable on all trading terminals and trading bots (including Jupiter Pro, Axiom, Photon, GMGN, BullX etc.)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Migration

### Migration Keeper

We run 2 migration keepers on Mainnet to automatically migrate DBC pools to DAMM pools.

Keeper addresses that we are running:
- [CQdrEsYAxRqkwmpycuTwnMKggr3cr9fqY8Qma4J9TudY](https://solscan.io/account/CQdrEsYAxRqkwmpycuTwnMKggr3cr9fqY8Qma4J9TudY)
- [DeQ8dPv6ReZNQ45NfiWwS5CchWpB2BVq1QMyNV8L2uSW](https://solscan.io/account/DeQ8dPv6ReZNQ45NfiWwS5CchWpB2BVq1QMyNV8L2uSW)

Our migration keepers have a `migration_quote_threshold` requirement (depending on your `quote_mint`) of at least:
- 10 SOL
- 1000 USDC
- 1500 JUP

<Note>The Migration Keeper only runs on Mainnet.</Note>

### Manual Migrator

We have created a [Manual Migrator](https://migrator.meteora.ag) user interface that allows you to manually migrate your DBC pool to a DAMM pool on both Mainnet and Devnet. 

<Note>Depending on your DBC Config Key, the migration process will require you to sign more than one transaction to call each instruction.</Note>
