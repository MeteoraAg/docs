## How to Choose a Suitable Pool Config

What fee parameters to choose depends on your project's needs. You will need to look at the pool [config list](https://amm-v2.meteora.ag/swagger-ui/#/pools/get_all_pool_configs) and choose a suitable `pool_config_key` with your preferred fee parameters.

If you want to create an Alpha Vault along with your new pool, you also need to find a `pool_config_key` that is mapped to a `vault_config_key` that meets your requirements.

## Public Pool Config List

**Mainnet Pool Config List API:** [https://amm-v2.meteora.ag/swagger-ui/#/pools/get_all_pool_configs](https://amm-v2.meteora.ag/swagger-ui/#/pools/get_all_pool_configs)

**Devnet Pool Config List API:** [https://devnet-amm-v2.meteora.ag/pool-configs](https://devnet-amm-v2.meteora.ag/pool-configs) 

**API endpoint to return the associated fee curve for each existing config:** [https://amm-v2.meteora.ag/swagger-ui/#/fee_config/get_config_associated_fee_configs](https://amm-v2.meteora.ag/swagger-ui/#/fee_config/get_config_associated_fee_configs)

- Using this endpoint, integrators can input the config pubkey, and it will return an array of fee update timings for the config, if there's any.

- Integrators may choose a `pool_config_key` with a fee curve that suits your integration.

If there is no existing config in the list that fits your project's requirement, a new config needs to be created.

<Note>Only the Meteora team can create a new config to add it to the preset pool config list.</Note>

## Default Pool Config Used by Meteora Frontend

By default, Meteora's frontend is currently using this pool config key for Memecoin Pool creation: 

```
FiENCCbPi3rFh5pW2AJ59HC53yM32eLaCjMKxRqanKFJ
```

For the `FiENCCbPi3rFh5pW2AJ59HC53yM32eLaCjMKxRqanKFJ` pool config, it doesn't allow creation of any Alpha Vault, therefore its field `vault_config_key` is `1111111...`

## New Custom Pool Config and Fee Curve for Integrators / Launchpads

### Custom Pool Config Key

Integrators such as launchpads or other partners may need to use their own unique custom pool config key, if they want custom `pool_creator_authority` to prevent front-running of the token launch pool.

<Note>New dedicated config keys can only be created by Meteora. Please reach out to us if this is required.</Note>

<Note>The `pool_creator_authority` doesn't work with program address. It's not a program whitelist, it needs to be a PDA (program derived address) or normal account.</Note>


### Custom Fee Curve

If you are an integrator, Meteora can also apply a custom fee curve/schedule for your pools, but we will need to create a dedicated config key for your team, where `pool_creator_authority` is linked to your signer wallet for pool creation. You would need to send us your signer wallet that would be used to deploy the pools.

<Note>Even with a dedicated config key for your team, Meteora would need to customize the fee curve/schedule for you. You can't do it on your own.</Note>

## Custom Fee Curve for a Specific Pool

If required, Meteora can set a custom fee curve for a single, specific pool. This would override the fee curve used by the pool's config key, doesn't matter which config key is used.

## API to Track Associated Fee Curve for Each Config

Meteora has an API endpoint to return the associated fee curve for each existing config: [https://amm-v2.meteora.ag/swagger-ui/#/fee_config/get_config_associated_fee_configs](https://amm-v2.meteora.ag/swagger-ui/#/fee_config/get_config_associated_fee_configs)

Using this endpoint, integrators can input the config pubkey, and it will return an array of fee update timings for the config, if there's any. Integrators may then choose a config with a fee curve that suits their integration.

### Steps to Check Fee Curves

## Understanding Pool Config Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `config_address` | The pool config key |
| `trade_fee_bps` | Pool trading fee |
| `protocol_fee_bps` | Protocol fee charged from pool trading fee |
| `activation_duration` | Used to determine when exactly the pool will start trading |
| `vault_config_key` | Alpha vault config key. If it is `11111111111111111111111111111111`, means no alpha vault. If not, the pool can create an alpha vault. **Note:** This is NOT the same as the vault address. |
| `pool_creator_authority` | Address which can use the pool config key to create a pool. If it is `11111111111111111111111111111111`, it's public and available for everyone to use |
| `activation_type` | Pool activation type. `0` = slot, `1` = time |

**Start trade time calculation**
- `current_time + activation_duration` OR
- `current_slot + activation_duration` (depends on the `activation_type`)

## Pool Config Example

**Sample:** [https://amm-v2.meteora.ag/pool-configs](https://amm-v2.meteora.ag/pool-configs)

```json
{
  "config_address": "FiENCCbPi3rFh5pW2AJ59HC53yM32eLaCjMKxRqanKFJ",
  "trade_fee_bps": 1500,
  "protocol_fee_bps": 2000,
  "activation_duration": 0,
  "vault_config_key": "11111111111111111111111111111111",
  "pool_creator_authority": "11111111111111111111111111111111",
  "activation_type": 0
}
```

## User Flow Example

A pool config may or may not have an associated vault config. There's no vault config associated when the `vault_config_key` is `11111111111111111111111111111111`.

When the pool config has a vault config, user can create the pool + Alpha Vault that is binded (auto-whitelisted) by the pool. The Alpha Vault created will inherit the parameters (Pro Rata / FCFS + buying_cap, vesting duration, etc.) from the vault config.

### Creating Pool ABC/SOL with an Alpha Vault

Let's say a user wants to create the pool ABC/SOL with an Alpha Vault, the user will need to:

1. **Check for pool config** that have `vault_config_key` not = `1111...`, and `pool_creator_authority` is the user or `1111...` (accessible by the public)

2. **Based on the vault requirement** the user wants, the user will need to:
   - a) Check all the pool configs from step 1, which are each mapped to a `vault_config_key`, as well as
   - b) Check for vault config and look for one that fits the requirement

3. **If the user finds a requirement** that suits their needs, they can use that `pool_config_key` to create the pool, then use the pool config-mapped `vault_config_key` to create the vault. As long as `vault_config_key` is used, the vault is automatically whitelisted upon pool creation.

All the settings are already predefined by `pool_config` + its mapped `vault_config_key`.

<Note>The permutations for pool config + Alpha vault are created by the Meteora team.</Note>

### Pool Config Example

```json
{
  "config_address": "8aPHoLN8ke6PhWeYA7ELi19fppptVYUCQvqKWR5yP1sn",
  "trade_fee_bps": 150,
  "protocol_fee_bps": 2000,
  "activation_duration": 1512000,
  "vault_config_key": "7ixojP8Zuu4csfTycHi8ywQymHm9zxAhu1TjnFuJaq2R",
  "pool_creator_authority": "5unTfT2kssBuNvHPY6LbJfJpLqEcdMxGYLWHwShaeTLi",
  "activation_type": 0
}
```

### Alpha Vault Config Example

```json
{
  "address": "7ixojP8Zuu4csfTycHi8ywQymHm9zxAhu1TjnFuJaq2R",
  "max_depositing_cap": 10,
  "start_vesting_duration": 1,
  "end_vesting_duration": 24107,
  "depositing_duration_until_last_join_point": 24107,
  "individual_depositing_cap": 1,
  "escrow_fee": 0,
  "activation_type": 0
}
```

In this example above, only the `pool_creator_authority` => `5unTfT2kssBuNvHPY6LbJfJpLqEcdMxGYLWHwShaeTLi` can use the pool config `8aPHoLN8ke6PhWeYA7ELi19fppptVYUCQvqKWR5yP1sn` to create a pool with the below settings:

- **1.5% fee**
- **20% protocol fee**
- Pool start trade after **1512000 slot** upon creation
- **Slot based activation**

And can create a binded Alpha Vault with **FCFS config** as shown below:

- Max deposit cap = **10 token**
- Vested over **24106 slot** after pool activate
- Deposit opens at **24107 slot** before vault crank
- Every escrow maximum can only deposit **1 token**
