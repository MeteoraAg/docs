# Dynamic Automated Market Maker v2 (DAMM v2)

Initialize your own constant product liquidity pool with DAMM v2. DAMM v2 allows you to optimize transaction fees, an option to set single-side liquidity, the flexibility of concentrating liquidty providing etc.

## Program Address

- Mainnet-beta: `cpamdpZCGKUy5JxQXB4dcpGPiikHawvSWAd6mEn1sGG`
- Devnet: `cpamdpZCGKUy5JxQXB4dcpGPiikHawvSWAd6mEn1sGG`

## Resources

- [DAMM v2 Program](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/damm-v2)
- [DAMM v2 Typescript SDK](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/damm-v2-sdk)
- [Interface Definition Language (IDL)](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/damm-v2-sdk/blob/main/src/idl/cp_amm.json)
- Pool Authority of DAMM v2: [HLnpSz9h2S4hiLQ43rnSD9XkcUThA7B8hQMKmDaiTLcC](https://solscan.io/account/HLnpSz9h2S4hiLQ43rnSD9XkcUThA7B8hQMKmDaiTLcC)

## Features

### Position NFT

The position state manages `unlocked_liquidity` + `locked_liquidity` + `vested liquidity`. 

User can interact with the following flows in the same, single position:

- Permanently lock part of the liquidity
- Create multiple vesting schedules
- Add more liquidity (unlocked liquidity)

The Position NFT is also a transferrable NFT that can be sent to other wallets.

### Farming

For DAMM v2, there is an in-built farming mechanism within the program. This is unlike DAMM v1, where there is a separate farming program.

Each specific pool in DAMM v2 can create farming rewards and the pool has its own unique reward vault. Each reward vault can have a maximum of 2 types of reward tokens. 

When the `initialize_reward` program endpoint is used, a `reward_vault` for the specific pool is created, and the initiator can specify the reward token (max 2 types) for the `reward_vault` 

Rewards will be shared with all liquidity providers over the farming duration.

Currently, in this beta stage:
1. The `initialize_reward` program endpoint can only be initialized by Meteora's admin
2. Only a whitelisted funder address can fund rewards into this `reward_vault` 

So for now, projects have to reach out to the Meteora team to create a farm and add rewards. We're exploring ways to make this process permissionless at a later stage.

### Fee Collection

DAMM v2 pools can collect fees in quote token or output token.

#### Quote Token `collect_fee_mode`

- Swap Quote Token to Base Token, then fees are taken from Quote Token before swap.
- Swap Base Token to Quote Token, then fees are taken from Quote Token after swap.

#### Output Token `collect_fee_mode`

- Swap Quote Token to Base Token, then fees are taken from Base Token after swap.
- Swap Base Token to Quote Token, then fees are taken from Quote Token after swap.

### Min-Max Price

In general, you can set a min-max price range for a balanced pool as DAMM v2 is a constant product AMM that follows a balanced ratio deposit.

If you need to set a min-max price range, as well as implement imbalanced deposits for the pool, you need to use [DLMM](/overview/products/dlmm/1-what-is-dlmm.mdx) instead.
