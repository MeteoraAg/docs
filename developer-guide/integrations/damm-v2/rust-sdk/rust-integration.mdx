The `rust-sdk` provides a convenient way to interact with the DAMM v2 program and get swap quotes.

Before you begin, here are some important resources:

-   **Program ID (Mainnet & Devnet):** `cpamdpZCGKUy5JxQXB4dcpGPiikHawvSWAd6mEn1sGG`
-   **Rust SDK:** [DAMM v2](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/damm-v2/tree/main/rust-sdk)

# Getting Started

To use the Rust SDK, you need to add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file. Since it's a local dependency in this workspace, you can add it by specifying its path:

```toml
[dependencies]
rust-sdk = { path = "../rust-sdk" } # Adjust the path accordingly
cp-amm = { path = "../programs/cp-amm" } # The sdk also needs the cp-amm crate
solana-sdk = "1.18.12" # For Pubkey
```

# API Reference

## `get_quote`

Calculates the result of a swap for a given pool.

### Parameters

- `pool: &Pool`: A reference to the `Pool` state account, deserialized from on-chain data.
- `current_timestamp: u64`: The current blockchain timestamp.
- `current_slot: u64`: The current blockchain slot.
- `actual_amount_in: u64`: The amount of the input token to be swapped.
- `a_to_b: bool`: The direction of the swap. `true` for token A to token B, `false` for token B to token A.
- `has_referral: bool`: Indicates if a referral fee should be considered.

### Returns

A `Result<SwapResult>` which contains the details of the swap if successful, including `amount_out`, fees, and new liquidity states.
