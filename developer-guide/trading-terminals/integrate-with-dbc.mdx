title: Integrate with DBC
description: Everything you need to know to integrate with Meteora's DBC Program
---

Trading Terminals can easily integrate with Meteora DBC by following this guide that explains in detail how to get the necessary data from indexing the DBC program.

## Bonding Curve Progress

### Core Formula

```
bondingCurveProgress = poolState.quoteReserve / poolConfigState.migration_quote_threshold
```

There are 2 ways you can get the quote reserve:

1. From the `poolState.quoteReserve` state in a DBC pool.
2. From the `nextSqrtPrice` in the swap CPI logs.
3. Directly from `EvtSwap2` swap CPI logs.

#### 1. Get Quote Reserve from Pool State

```typescript
const client = new DynamicBondingCurveClient(connection, "confirmed");
const poolState = await client.state.getPool(poolAddress);
const quoteReserve = poolState.quoteReserve;
```

#### 2. Get Quote Reserve from Next Sqrt Price

Using the `get_quote_token_from_sqrt_price` function

```rust
pub fn get_quote_token_from_sqrt_price(next_sqrt_price: u128, config: &PoolConfig) -> Result<U256> {
    let mut total_amount = U256::ZERO;
    for i in 0..MAX_CURVE_POINT {
        let lower_sqrt_price = if i == 0 {
            config.sqrt_start_price
        } else {
            config.curve[i - 1].sqrt_price
        };
        if next_sqrt_price > lower_sqrt_price {
            let upper_sqrt_price = if next_sqrt_price < config.curve[i + 1].sqrt_price {
                next_sqrt_price
            } else {
                config.curve[i + 1].sqrt_price
            };
            let max_amount_in = get_delta_amount_quote_unsigned_256(
                lower_sqrt_price,
                upper_sqrt_price,
                config.curve[i].liquidity,
                Rounding::Up,
            )?;

            total_amount = total_amount.safe_add(max_amount_in)?;
        }
    }

    Ok(total_amount)
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the `getQuoteReserveFromNextSqrtPrice` function in the [DBC TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve-sdk/blob/main/packages/dynamic-bonding-curve/docs.md#getQuoteReserveFromNextSqrtPrice) as it is the typescript version of the above function.

#### 3. Directly from `EvtSwap2` swap CPI logs

Example of an `EvtSwap2` swap CPI logs:

```json
{
  "pool": "51mjM3ne2AiMHfeox78yjwwks7tF6sYokuuMkibAkSpn",
  "config": "H4r8wEqix3mN6WDv7qZKaAdQj3GYg7xBMbFND4Cx9Bwt",
  "tradeDirection": 0,
  "hasReferral": false,
  "swapParameters": {
    "amount0": "797867598488800000",
    "amount1": "4900009949",
    "swapMode": 0
  },
  "swapResult": {
    "includedFeeInputAmount": "797867598488800000",
    "excludedFeeInputAmount": "797867598488800000",
    "amountLeft": "0",
    "outputAmount": "4900499999",
    "nextSqrtPrice": "748125024131879",
    "tradingFee": "39600000",
    "protocolFee": "9900000",
    "referralFee": "0"
  },
  "quoteReserveAmount": "1",
  "migrationThreshold": "5000000000",
  "currentTimestamp": "1756275517"
}
```

## Total Fees

```
totalFees = baseFees + dynamicFees
```

### Base Fees

Base Fees includes either a Flat Fee or a Fee Scheduler or Rate Limiter. 

<Note>
    `BaseFeeMode` can only be enums 0, 1, or 2.
    - 0 = Linear Fee Scheduler
    - 1 = Exponential Fee Scheduler
    - 2 = Rate Limiter
</Note>

#### Flat Fee

You can fetch the flat fee directly from the `cliffFeeNumerator` in the `baseFee` object if `firstFactor`, `secondFactor`, and `thirdFactor` are all 0.

```typescript
// Example
baseFee: {
  cliffFeeNumerator: <BN: 10000000>, // 1% flat fee
  firstFactor: 0, 
  secondFactor: <BN: 0>, 
  thirdFactor: <BN: 0>, 
  baseFeeMode: 0
}
```

<Warning>
The Fee Scheduler and Rate Limiter depends on the `poolState.activationType`. 

- If the `poolState.activationType == 0`, then `numberOfPeriod` and `periodFrequency` is calculated in `SLOT == 400ms`
- If the `poolState.activationType == 1`, then `numberOfPeriod` and `periodFrequency` is calculated in `SECONDS == 1000ms`
</Warning>

#### Fee Scheduler

- For Fee Scheduler, it contains `numberOfPeriod`, `periodFrequency`, and `reductionFactor` which are paired with the `firstFactor`, `secondFactor`, and `thirdFactor` respectively.

- `baseFeeMode` can only be 0 or 1.

```typescript
interface BaseFee = {
    cliffFeeNumerator: BN
    firstFactor: number // numberOfPeriod
    secondFactor: BN // periodFrequency
    thirdFactor: BN // reductionFactor
    baseFeeMode: BaseFeeMode // 0 or 1
}
```

<Note>You can refer to the math formula for the Fee Scheduler [here](/anti-sniper-suite/fee-time-scheduler/fee-time-scheduler-math)</Note>

Here are some examples of how the Fee Scheduler works:

```typescript
// Fee Scheduler: 50% reduce to 1% in 10 minutes linearly
baseFee: {
  cliffFeeNumerator: <BN: 500000000>,
  firstFactor: 60, // numberOfPeriods
  secondFactor: <BN: 8166666>, // periodFrequency 
  thirdFactor: <BN: 10>, // reduction factor
  baseFeeMode: 0
},
```

```typescript
// Fee Scheduler: 50% reduce to 1% in 10 minutes exponentially
baseFee: {
  cliffFeeNumerator: <BN: 500000000>,
  firstFactor: 60, // numberOfPeriods
  secondFactor: <BN: 631>, // periodFrequency 
  thirdFactor: <BN: 10>, // reduction factor
  baseFeeMode: 1
},
```

#### Rate Limiter

- For Rate Limiter, it contains `feeIncrementBps`, `maxLimiterDuration`, and `referenceAmount` which are paired with the `firstFactor`, `secondFactor`, and `thirdFactor` respectively.

- `baseFeeMode` can only be 2.

```typescript
interface BaseFee = {
    cliff_fee_numerator: BN
    first_factor: number //feeIncrementBps
    secondFactor: BN // maxLimiterDuration
    thirdFactor: BN // referenceAmount
    baseFeeMode: BaseFeeMode // 2
}
```

<Note>You can refer to the math formula for the Rate Limiter [here](/anti-sniper-suite/rate-limiter/rate-limiter-math)</Note>

Here are some examples of how the Rate Limiter works:

```typescript
// Rate Limiter: Starts at 1% fee -> Exponential increase in fee for 10 slots based on trade size
// 0.5 SOL trade
// fee = 0.5 SOL * 0.1% = 0.0005 SOL
// 1.5 SOL trade
// fee = 1 SOL * 0.1% + 0.5 SOL * 0.2% = 0.002 SOL
// 3 SOL trade
// fee = 1 SOL * 0.1% + 1 SOL * 0.2% + 1 SOL * 0.3% = 0.006 SOL
baseFee: {
   cliffFeeNumerator: new BN(10_000_000), 
   firstFactor: 10, // feeIncrementBps
   secondFactor: new BN(10), // maxLimiterDuration
   thirdFactor: new BN(1000000000), // referenceAmount
   baseFeeMode: 2, // rate limiter mode
}
```

### Dynamic Fees (Variable Fee)

You can refer to the Dynamic Fee calculation [here](/overview/products/dbc/trading-fees-calculation#dynamic-fee-variable-fee)

## Plotting Charts

<Danger>Using Transfer logs from Swap transactions is not the correct way of getting the token price as we have Anti-Sniper Suite features that can cause huge fee deductions from `TokenAmountIn` OR `TokenAmountOut`. Plotting the token chart price from these will lead to a very ugly chart.</Danger>

The correct way is to fetch the `EvtSwap2` CPI logs from the Swap transaction. 

<Note>`EvtSwap` is an older version of the swap CPI logs and might be deprecated in the future. Use `EvtSwap2` instead.</Note>

Because of the Anti-Sniper Suite features, you will have to apply the following checks to get the correct token price either before/after the fee deduction.

```
if excludedFeeInputAmount != includedFeeInputAmount then:
-> excludedFeeInputAmount <> outputAmount

if excludedFeeInputAmount == includedFeeInputAmount then:
-> excludedFeeInputAmount <> outputAmount + tradingFee + protocolFee + referralFee
```

## Trading Volume

Track from Swap CPI logs:

```
// Depending on Trade Direction:
trading_volume += excludedFeeInputAmount * token_price
```

## Liquidity

In the bonding curve, the liquidity is fetched from the virtual quote reserve of the bonding curve pool.

```
liquidity = poolState.quoteReserve * quoteTokenPrice
```

## Locked Vesting

```
total_vesting_amount = cliff_unlock_amount + (amount_per_period * number_of_period)
```

## Migration

- You can check whether the DBC pool has migrated via the `isMigrated` flag from the [DBC pool state](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/blob/main/programs/dynamic-bonding-curve/src/state/virtual_pool.rs).
- You can also check the MigrationProgress from the [DBC pool state](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/blob/main/programs/dynamic-bonding-curve/src/state/virtual_pool.rs) via the `MigrationProgress` parameter.

```rust
IsMigrated::NotMigrated  // 0
IsMigrated::Migrated // 1
```

```rust
MigrationProgress::PreBondingCurve  // 0
MigrationProgress::PostBondingCurve // 1
MigrationProgress::LockedVesting    // 2
MigrationProgress::CreatedPool      // 3
```

### Meteora's DBC Migration Keepers

- We run a total of 2 DBC Migration Keepers to migrate the DBC pools. These migration keepers each have their individual threshold requirements of >= 750 USD worth of `quoteReserve` to migrate the pool provided `quoteReserve >= migrationQuoteThreshold`.
- You can check out the migration keepers [here](/developer-guide/guides/dbc/overview#migration-keeper).
- If you would like to clear our tokens that are stuck (such that their `quoteReserve` is less than 750 USD worth of `quoteToken`), you can use the [Manual Migrator](https://migrator.meteora.ag/) to manually migrate the pool.

### How to Identify Launchpads Using DBC

You can ping us on Discord to get a list of all launchpads configuration so that you can index them on your trading terminal.

<Note>Open a ticket on [discord](https://discord.gg/meteora) to get access to the list.</Note>

## Referral Account

- For trading terminals, we have a feature that enables trading terminals to earn referral fees from all swaps that happens on our Meteora DBC program as long as they were swapped through your trading terminal.
- For referral fees, simply add your [referral token account](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/blob/main/programs/dynamic-bonding-curve/src/instructions/ix_swap.rs#L30) within the swap instruction & you will receive 20% of the protocol fees for all swaps.
