title: Integrate with DAMM v2
description: Everything you need to know to integrate with Meteora's DAMM v2 Program
---

Trading Terminals can easily integrate with Meteora DAMM v2 by following this guide that explains in detail how to get the necessary data from indexing the DAMM v2 program. 

## Total Fees

```
totalFees = baseFees + dynamicFees
```

### Base Fees

Base Fees includes either a Flat Fee or a Fee Scheduler or Rate Limiter. 

<Note>
    `BaseFeeMode` can only be enums 0, 1, or 2.
    - 0 = Linear Fee Scheduler
    - 1 = Exponential Fee Scheduler
    - 2 = Rate Limiter
</Note>

#### Flat Fee

You can fetch the flat fee directly from the `cliffFeeNumerator` in the `baseFee` object if `firstFactor`, `secondFactor`, and `thirdFactor` are all 0.

```typescript
// Example
baseFee: {
  cliffFeeNumerator: <BN: 10000000>, // 1% flat fee
  firstFactor: 0, 
  secondFactor: <BN: 0>, 
  thirdFactor: <BN: 0>, 
  baseFeeMode: 0
}
```

<Warning>
The Fee Scheduler depends on the `poolState.activationType`. 

- If the `poolState.activationType == 0`, then `numberOfPeriod` and `periodFrequency` is calculated in `SLOT == 400ms`
- If the `poolState.activationType == 1`, then `numberOfPeriod` and `periodFrequency` is calculated in `SECONDS == 1000ms`
</Warning>

#### Fee Scheduler

- For Fee Scheduler, it contains `numberOfPeriod`, `periodFrequency`, and `reductionFactor` which are paired with the `firstFactor`, `secondFactor`, and `thirdFactor` respectively.

```typescript
interface BaseFee = {
    cliffFeeNumerator: BN
    firstFactor: number // numberOfPeriod
    secondFactor: BN // periodFrequency
    thirdFactor: BN // reductionFactor
    baseFeeMode: BaseFeeMode // 0 or 1
}
```

<Note>You can refer to the math formula for the Fee Scheduler [here](/anti-sniper-suite/fee-scheduler/fee-scheduler-math)</Note>

Here are some examples of how the Fee Scheduler works:

```typescript
// Fee Scheduler: 50% reduce to 1% in 10 minutes linearly
baseFee: {
  cliffFeeNumerator: <BN: 500000000>,
  firstFactor: 60, // numberOfPeriods
  secondFactor: <BN: 8166666>, // periodFrequency 
  thirdFactor: <BN: 10>, // reduction factor
  baseFeeMode: 0
},
```

```typescript
// Fee Scheduler: 50% reduce to 1% in 10 minutes exponentially
baseFee: {
  cliffFeeNumerator: <BN: 500000000>,
  firstFactor: 60, // numberOfPeriods
  secondFactor: <BN: 631>, // periodFrequency 
  thirdFactor: <BN: 10>, // reduction factor
  baseFeeMode: 1
},
```

#### Rate Limiter

- For Rate Limiter, it contains `feeIncrementBps`, `maxLimiterDuration`, and `referenceAmount` which are paired with the `firstFactor`, `secondFactor`, and `thirdFactor` respectively.

- `baseFeeMode` can only be 2.

```typescript
interface BaseFee = {
    cliff_fee_numerator: BN
    first_factor: number //feeIncrementBps
    secondFactor: BN // maxLimiterDuration
    thirdFactor: BN // referenceAmount
    baseFeeMode: BaseFeeMode // 2
}
```

<Note>You can refer to the math formula for the Rate Limiter [here](/anti-sniper-suite/rate-limiter/rate-limiter-math)</Note>

Here are some examples of how the Rate Limiter works:

```typescript
// Rate Limiter: Starts at 1% fee -> Exponential increase in fee for 10 slots based on trade size
// 0.5 SOL trade
// fee = 0.5 SOL * 0.1% = 0.0005 SOL
// 1.5 SOL trade
// fee = 1 SOL * 0.1% + 0.5 SOL * 0.2% = 0.002 SOL
// 3 SOL trade
// fee = 1 SOL * 0.1% + 1 SOL * 0.2% + 1 SOL * 0.3% = 0.006 SOL
baseFee: {
   cliffFeeNumerator: new BN(10_000_000), 
   firstFactor: 10, // feeIncrementBps
   secondFactor: new BN(10), // maxLimiterDuration
   thirdFactor: new BN(1000000000), // referenceAmount
   baseFeeMode: 2, // rate limiter mode
}
```

### Dynamic Fees (Variable Fee)

You can refer to the Dynamic Fee calculation [here](/overview/products/damm-v2/pool-fees-calculation#dynamic-fee-variable-fee)

## Plotting Charts

<Danger>Using Transfer logs from Swap transactions is not the correct way of getting the token price as we have Anti-Sniper Suite features that can cause huge fee deductions from `TokenAmountIn` OR `TokenAmountOut`. Plotting the token chart price from these will lead to a very ugly chart.</Danger>

The correct way is to fetch the `EvtSwap2` CPI logs from the Swap transaction. 

<Note>`EvtSwap` is an older version of the swap CPI logs and might be deprecated in the future. Use `EvtSwap2` instead.</Note>

Because of the Anti-Sniper Suite features, you will have to apply the following checks to get the correct token price either before/after the fee deduction.

[1.1] Firstly, you will need to identify where the fees are coming from (either from input or output): 

```
feeOnInput: (collectFeeMode == 1 && tradeDirection == 1)? true: false
```

[1.2] Next, calculate the amount and plot price depending on where the fees are coming from (either from input or output):

```
if (feeOnInput): price = excludedFeeInputAmount / outputAmount

if (!feeOnInput): price = excludedFeeInputAmount / outputAmount + tradingFee + protocolFee + referralFee + partnerFee
```

## Trading Volume

Track from Swap CPI logs:

```
// Depending on Trade Direction:
trading_volume += actualAmountIn * token_price
```

## Liquidity

In the DAMM v2 pool, the liquidity is fetched from the `tokenAVault` and `tokenBVault` of the DAMM v2 pool.

```
liquidity = tokenAVault * tokenAPrice + tokenBVault * tokenBPrice
```

## Locked or Vested Liquidity

In DAMM v2, there are 3 different modes for liquidity:
1. `lockedLiquidity` - which means that the liquidity is permanently locked
2. `vestedLiquidity` - which means that the liqudiity is vestedLiquidity
3. `unlockedLiquidity` - which means that the liquidity is unlocked and claimable

You can use our DAMM v2 API [endpoint](/api-reference/pools/get_pool_vesting_list) that tracks pool positions and show accurately whether the liqudiity is locked or not on your trading terminal.

### How to Identify Launchpads Using DAMM v2

You can ping us on Discord to get a list of all launchpads configuration who are launching on DAMM v2 directly so that you can index them on your trading terminal.

<Note>Open a ticket on [discord](https://discord.gg/meteora) to get access to the list.</Note>

## Referral Account

- For trading terminals, we have a feature that enables trading terminals to earn referral fees from all swaps that happens on our Meteora DBC program as long as they were swapped through your trading terminal.
- For referral fees, simply add your [referral token account](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/dynamic-bonding-curve/blob/main/programs/dynamic-bonding-curve/src/instructions/ix_swap.rs#L30) within the swap instruction & you will receive 20% of the protocol fees for all swaps.
