# Guides

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="DLMM" icon="arrows-to-circle" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/guides/dlmm/introduction">
    DLMM (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker) implements a bin-based liquidity distribution model with algorithmic fee adjustment mechanisms based on market volatility metrics. Liquidity providers can deploy capital across discrete price bins with configurable spreads, enabling concentrated liquidity positioning with real-time fee optimization through volatility-sensitive pricing algorithms.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DAMM v2" icon="calculator-simple" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/guides/damm-v2/introduction">
    DAMM v2 (Dynamic Automatic Market Maker v2) implements a constant-product invariant (x*y=k) with enhanced features including SPL/Token-2022 compatibility, optional concentrated liquidity ranges, position NFTs, algorithmic onchain fee scheduling, programmable fee distribution mechanisms, and native yield farming integration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DAMM v1" icon="infinity" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/guides/damm-v1/introduction">
    DAMM v1 (Dynamic Automatic Market Maker v1) utilizes a constant-product formula with infinite price range support (0 < P < âˆž) and integrated yield aggregation through external lending protocol interfaces. The architecture enables composite yield generation via swap fee accrual and external DeFi protocol interaction, with automated capital efficiency optimization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Bonding Curve" icon="chart-simple" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/guides/dbc/introduction">
    Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC) implements customizable mathematical pricing functions with configurable curve parameters for token launch mechanisms. The protocol supports arbitrary curve geometries with programmable price discovery algorithms, featuring virtual AMM states that migrate to dynamic AMM pools upon reaching predetermined liquidity thresholds through automated graduation logic.
  </Card>
    <Card title="Dynamic Vault" icon="vault" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/guides/dynamic-vault/introduction">
    Dynamic Vaults implement algorithmic yield optimization through multi-protocol asset allocation strategies, utilizing the Hermes yield aggregation engine for automated capital deployment across lending markets. The system employs mathematical optimization algorithms to maximize risk-adjusted returns for DAMM v1 and memecoin pool liquidity providers through dynamic rebalancing mechanisms.
  </Card>
    <Card title="Alpha Vault" icon="box" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/guides/alpha-vault/introduction">
    Alpha Vault implements a complementary anti-bot mechanism for token launches, providing early access for genuine supporters to deposit and purchase tokens before public trading begins. The system features configurable parameters including deposit caps, lock-up periods, and vesting schedules, with support for both pro-rata and FCFS distribution modes across DLMM, DAMM v1, and DAMM v2 launch pools.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stake2Earn" icon="steak" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/guides/stake2earn/introduction">
    Stake2Earn is a mechanism where top memecoin stakers compete to earn fee rewards from permanently-locked liquidity in the memecoin pool, transforming memecoins from a race to dump to a race to stake. Whether as a memecoin holder right from launch or a new holder just entering the game, Stake2Earn offers a unique opportunity to earn fee rewards through staking.
  </Card>
    <Card title="Meteora Lock" icon="lock" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/guides/meteora-lock/introduction">
      Meteora Lock is an open-source, permissionless, free and audited alternative to release your projectâ€™s tokens over time. Meteora Lock is **free -- zero fees**, allowing any project to release their tokens over-time for free.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Dynamic Fee Sharing" icon="money-bill-wave" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/guides/dynamic-fee-sharing/introduction">
      Dynamic Fee Sharing is a helper program that allows for the creation of fee vaults where collected fees can be automatically distributed among multiple recipients based on predetermined share allocations. 
  </Card>
  {/* <Card title="Zap" icon="bolt-lightning" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/guides/zap/introduction">
      Zap is a wrapper program that provides utility functions that allow users to zap in/out from any AMMs or Jupiter. For example, a user can claim both token fee rewards and immediately swap the withdrawn tokens through DAMM v2, DLMM or Jupiter.
