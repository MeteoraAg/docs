## Devnet

Our programs are deployed on devnet as well.

We also provide a devnet version of Meteora at https://devnet.meteora.ag.

## Integrations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="DLMM" icon="arrows-to-circle" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/integrations/dlmm/1-introduction">
    DLMM (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker) implements a bin-based liquidity distribution model with algorithmic fee adjustment mechanisms based on market volatility metrics. Liquidity providers can deploy capital across discrete price bins with configurable spreads, enabling concentrated liquidity positioning with real-time fee optimization through volatility-sensitive pricing algorithms.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DAMM v2" icon="calculator-simple" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/integrations/damm-v2/1-introduction">
    DAMM v2 (Dynamic Automatic Market Maker v2) implements a constant-product invariant (x*y=k) with enhanced features including SPL/Token-2022 compatibility, optional concentrated liquidity ranges, position NFTs, algorithmic onchain fee scheduling, programmable fee distribution mechanisms, and native yield farming integration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DAMM v1" icon="infinity" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/integrations/damm-v1/1-introduction">
    DAMM v1 (Dynamic Automatic Market Maker v1) utilizes a constant-product formula with infinite price range support (0 < P < âˆž) and integrated yield aggregation through external lending protocol interfaces. The architecture enables composite yield generation via swap fee accrual and external DeFi protocol interaction, with automated capital efficiency optimization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Bonding Curve" icon="chart-simple" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/integrations/dbc/1-introduction">
    Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC) implements customizable mathematical pricing functions with configurable curve parameters for token launch mechanisms. The protocol supports arbitrary curve geometries with programmable price discovery algorithms, featuring virtual AMM states that migrate to dynamic AMM pools upon reaching predetermined liquidity thresholds through automated graduation logic.
  </Card>
    <Card title="Alpha Vault" icon="box" iconType="solid" href="/developer-guide/integrations/alpha-vault/1-introduction">
    Dynamic Vaults implement algorithmic yield optimization through multi-protocol asset allocation strategies, utilizing the Hermes yield aggregation engine for automated capital deployment across lending markets. The system employs mathematical optimization algorithms to maximize risk-adjusted returns for DAMM v1 and memecoin pool liquidity providers through dynamic rebalancing mechanisms.
