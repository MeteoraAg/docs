## Setup

<Steps>
 <Step title="Clone and Setup Meteora Invent">
    Meteora Invent is a toolkit consisting of everything you need to invent innovative token launches on Meteora. Run the following command in your terminal to get started.

    ```bash Terminal
    git clone https://github.com/MeteoraAg/meteora-invent.git
    ```

    Once you've cloned the repository, you'll have a new project directory with a meteora-invent folder. Run the following to install pnpm and the project dependencies. 

    ```bash Terminal
    cd meteora-invent
    pnpm install
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup Environment Variables">
    Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the environment variables.

    ```bash
    cp scaffolds/fun-launch/.env.example scaffolds/fun-launch/.env
    ```

    ```env
    # Cloudflare R2 Storage
    R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_r2_access_key_id
    R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_r2_secret_access_key
    R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_r2_account_id
    R2_BUCKET=your_r2_bucket_name

    # Solana RPC URL
    RPC_URL=your_rpc_url

    # Pool Configuration
    POOL_CONFIG_KEY=your_pool_config_key
    ```

    <Tip>
        **Getting R2 Credentials**
        1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
        2. Navigate to R2
        3. Create a new bucket or select an existing one
        4. Go to "Manage R2 API Tokens"
        5. Create a new API token with the following permissions:
            - Account R2 Storage: Edit
            - Bucket: Your bucket name
        6. Copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
        7. Your Account ID can be found in the Cloudflare dashboard URL or in the Account Home page
    </Tip>

    <Tip>
        **Getting RPC URL**
        You can get your RPC URL from any 3rd party provider like [Triton](https://triton.one/) or [Helius](https://www.helius.dev).
    </Tip>

    <Tip>
        **Getting Pool Config Key**
        You can get your pool config key from [Meteora Launch](https://launch.meteora.ag) or execute an action with Metsumi to create a DBC config in [Meteora Invent](/developer-guide/invent/actions#dbc).
