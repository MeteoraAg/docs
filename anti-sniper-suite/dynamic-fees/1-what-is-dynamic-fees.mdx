title: What's Dynamic Fees?
---

Dynamic Fees acts as a form of surge pricing based on market fluctuations and volatility.

<Info>Available on **DLMM**, **DAMM V2** and **DBC**</Info>

## How does it work?

Since demand for tokens and price volatility are often the highest at launch, Dynamic Fee would also be high. This both mitigates against aggressive sniper bot purchases while capturing more fees for the token creator and LPs in the pool. 

The total swap fee consists of two components: **a base fee** and **a variable fee**. The base fee is configured by the pool creator and determined by the base factor and bin step. The variable fee is calculated based on real-time price volatility and is affected by swap frequencies and the number of bins crossed during a swap. These fees are calculated and distributed on a per-bin basis, ensuring fair distribution to LPs in each bin that is crossed. LPs can claim these fees whenever they are available.

## Which Launch Pools support Dynamic Fees?

All DLMM Pools have Dynamic Fees enabled by default, while creators have the option to use (or don't use) Dynamic Fees on DBC and DAMM V2 Launch Pools, based on their configuration.
