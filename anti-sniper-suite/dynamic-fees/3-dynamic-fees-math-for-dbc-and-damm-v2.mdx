title: Dynamic Fees Math for DBC & DAMM V2
---

Referencing [Total Trading Fee](/anti-sniper-suite/dynamic-fees/2-dlmm-dynamic-fees-math#total-trading-fee) in DLMM, the dynamic fee mechanism is designed to adjust trading fees based on market volatility. The total fee is a combination of a base fee and a dynamic, volatility-driven component.

## Dynamic Fee (Variable Fee)

The variable fee is the core of the dynamic fee mechanism. It increases with market volatility.

<div align="center">
$$f_v = (v_a \times s)^2 \times C / 100000000000$$
</div>

where:
- **Volatility Accumulator** ($v_a$): A measure of recent price volatility
- **Bin Step** ($s$): A parameter that defines the price granularity for measuring volatility  
- **Variable Fee Control** ($C$): A parameter to control the magnitude of the variable fee

## Volatility Accumulator

The Volatility Accumulator tracks price movements. It's updated with every swap.

<div align="center">
$$v_a = \min(v_{max}, v_r + \Delta p \times 10000)$$
</div>

where:
- **Max Volatility Accumulator** ($v_{max}$): A cap on the volatility measure to prevent fees from becoming excessively high
- **Volatility Reference** ($v_r$): A decayed value of the volatility accumulator
- **Price Change** ($\Delta p$): The price change since the last reference update, measured in "bins"

### Price Change
The price change is calculated based on the change in the square root of the price.

<div align="center">
$$\Delta p = (\sqrt{p_c / p_r} - 1) / s \times 2$$
</div>

where $p_c$ is current price and $p_r$ is reference price.

### Volatility Decay

To ensure that the dynamic fee reflects recent volatility, the Volatility Reference decays over time.

<div align="center">
$$v_r = v_a \times R / 10000$$
</div>

The decay mechanism is based on the time elapsed since the last significant trade:

- If elapsed time < filter period: No change. This ignores very high-frequency trades.
- If filter period ≤ elapsed time < decay period: The volatility reference is reduced.
- If elapsed time ≥ decay period: The volatility reference is reset to 0. This happens if there are no significant trades for an extended period.

## Max Dynamic Fee on DAMM V2 and DBC

Currently, the max dynamic fee on DAMM V2 and DBC is less than or equals to 20% of the Base Fee. 

Example: 
- Base Fee = 1%
- Dynamic Fee = 0.2%
- Total Trading/LP Fee = 1.2%
