For any token launch, sniper bots have an incredibly unfair advantage as they can buy up a substantial portion of the initial token supply right at the activation slot, at the earliest/lowest prices, in order to sell for a quick profit. This prevents tokens from being widely distributed and severely disadvantages genuine users and supporters of the token project.

Meteora has developed an advanced Anti-Sniper Suite (A.S.S.) to counter the threat of mercenary sniper bots during token launches, helping to provide a fairer experience for the community.

    Configurable fee decay over time designed to deter sniper bots by imposing higher fees during the initial launch phase.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rate Limiter" href="/anti-sniper-suite/rate-limiter" icon="square-2" iconType="solid">
    Configurable fee slope designed to deter sniper bots by increasing the fee depending on the trade size. If a user buys with an amount more than the reference amount, the fee will increase.

  <Card title="Alpha Vault" href="/anti-sniper-suite/alpha-vault" icon="square-3" iconType="solid">
    A complementary anti-bot mechanism used together with a Launch Pool that provides early access for genuine supporters to deposit and purchase tokens before the pool starts trading, thereby safeguarding the token launch against sniper bots.
