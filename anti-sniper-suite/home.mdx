For any token launch, sniper bots have an incredibly unfair advantage as they can buy up a substantial portion of the initial token supply right at the activation slot, at the earliest/lowest prices, in order to sell for a quick profit. This prevents tokens from being widely distributed and severely disadvantages genuine users and supporters of the token project.

Meteora has developed an advanced Anti-Sniper Suite (A.S.S.) to counter the threat of mercenary sniper bots during token launches, helping to provide a fairer experience for the community.
