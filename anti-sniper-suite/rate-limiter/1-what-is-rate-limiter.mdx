title: What's Rate Limiter?
---

<Info>Available on **DBC**</Info>

Rate Limiter is a configurable fee slope designed to deter sniper bots by increasing the fee depending on the trade size.

For example, if a user swaps 100 SOL, then the first SOL will be charged as 1%, the next SOL will be charged as 5%... until it fulfils the full input amount.

Similar to how tax brackets work in the real world, the fee slope increases when the trade size increases.

## How does it work?

Rate Limiter requires the following parameters to be configured:

- **Cliff Fee Numerator**: The base fee of the rate limiter.
- **Reference Amount**: The amount of tokens that will be charged at the base fee.
- **Fee Increment Bps**: The amount of basis points to increase the fee by.
- **Max Limiter Duration**: The maximum duration of the rate limiter.

With these parameters, the fee slope will increase by the **Fee Increment Bps** for each increment of **Reference Amount** of tokens swapped. This rate limiter will last for the duration of **Max Limiter Duration**. Any swap amount below the **Reference Amount** will be charged the **Cliff Fee Numerator**.

## Example:

If you have:

- `reference_amount` = 1 SOL
- `cliff_fee_numerator` = 1% (100 bps)
- `fee_increment_bps` = 100 bps (1%)

Then:

- Trading 1 SOL: 1% fee
- Trading 2 SOL: 1.5% average fee
- Trading 3 SOL: 2% average fee
- And so on...
