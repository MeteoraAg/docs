title: What's Rate Limiter?
---

<Info>Available on **DBC**</Info>

Rate Limiter is a configurable fee slope designed to deter sniper bots by increasing the fee depending on the trade size.

For example, if a user swaps 100 SOL, then the first SOL will be charged as 1%, the next SOL will be charged as 5%... until it fulfils the full input amount.

Similar to how tax brackets work in the real world, the fee slope increases when the trade size increases.

## How does it work?

Rate Limiter requires the following parameters to be configured:

- **Cliff Fee Numerator**: The base fee of the rate limiter.
- **Reference Amount**: The amount of tokens that will be charged at the base fee.
- **Fee Increment Bps**: The amount of basis points to increase the fee by.
- **Max Limiter Duration**: The maximum duration of the rate limiter.

With these parameters, the fee slope will increase by the **Fee Increment Bps** for each increment of **Reference Amount** of tokens swapped. This rate limiter will last for the duration of **Max Limiter Duration**. Any swap amount below the **Reference Amount** will be charged the **Cliff Fee Numerator**.

## Which Launch Pools support Rate Limiter?

Rate Limiter is available as an option for Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC).
