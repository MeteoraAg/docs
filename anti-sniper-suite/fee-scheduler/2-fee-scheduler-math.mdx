There are two types of fee schedulers:

1. **Linear**
2. **Exponential**

## Linear Fee Scheduler

A linear fee scheduler is a fee reduction mechanism that decreases trading fees at a constant rate over time. 

### Linear Fee Scheduler Formula

For Linear (0) baseFeeMode:

```
ending_fee = cliff_fee_numerator - (period * reduction_factor)
```

Where:
- `cliff_fee_numerator`: The initial fee amount at the start
- `number_of_periods`: The number of time periods
- `reduction_factor`: The constant amount by which the fee decreases each period (expressed in basis points)

## Exponential Fee Scheduler

An exponential fee scheduler is a fee reduction mechanism that decreases trading fees by a percentage of the current rate over time. 

### Exponential Fee Scheduler Formula

For Exponential (1) baseFeeMode:

```
ending_fee = cliff_fee_numerator * (1 - reduction_factor/10_000)^period
```

Where:
- `cliff_fee_numerator`: The initial fee amount at the start
- `reduction_factor`: The reduction factor (expressed in basis points)
- `number_of_periods`: The number of time period
