title: Fee Scheduler Math
---

There are two types of fee schedulers:

1. **Linear**
2. **Exponential**

# Linear Fee Scheduler Formula

A linear fee scheduler is a fee reduction mechanism that decreases trading fees at a constant rate over time. 

For Linear [0]:
<div style={{ fontSize: "0.9em" }}>
  ```math
  \text{Ending Fee} = \text{Cliff Fee Numerator} - (\text{Number Of Periods} \times \text{Reduction Factor})
  ```
</div>

Where:
- `cliff_fee_numerator`: The initial fee amount at the start
- `number_of_periods`: The number of time periods
- `reduction_factor`: The constant amount by which the fee decreases each period (expressed in basis points)

# Exponential Fee Scheduler Formula

An exponential fee scheduler is a fee reduction mechanism that decreases trading fees by a percentage of the current rate over time. 

For Exponential [1]:

<div style={{ fontSize: "0.9em" }}>
  ```math
  \text{Ending Fee} = \text{Cliff Fee Numerator} \times \left(1 - \frac{\text{Reduction Factor}}{10000}\right)^{\text{Number Of Periods}}
  ```
</div>

Where:
- `cliff_fee_numerator`: The initial fee amount at the start
- `reduction_factor`: The reduction factor (expressed in basis points)
- `number_of_periods`: The number of time period
