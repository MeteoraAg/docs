## Managing Cookies

### Browser Settings

Most browsers allow you to manage how cookies are set and used as you're browsing, and to clear cookies and browsing data. Also, your browser may have settings letting you manage cookies on a site-by-site basis. For example, Google Chrome's settings at `chrome://settings/cookies` allow you to delete existing cookies, allow or block all cookies, and set cookie preferences for websites. Google Chrome also offers Incognito mode, which deletes your browsing history and clears cookies from the Incognito windows on your device after you close all of your Incognito windows.

### Mobile Devices

Most mobile devices and applications also allow you to manage how similar technologies, such as unique identifiers used to identify an app or device, are set and used. For example, the Advertising ID on Android devices or Apple's Advertising Identifier can be managed in your device's settings, while app-specific identifiers may typically be managed in the app's settings.

<Note>
Kindly note that if you delete or block certain cookies, you may not be able to use all the Content made available on the Website.
