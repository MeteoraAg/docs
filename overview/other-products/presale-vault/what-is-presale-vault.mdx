# Overview

Meteora Presale is a flexible and comprehensive token presale program that enables creators to launch tokens with multiple participation modes, customizable access control, and built-in token vesting. Whether you're launching a memecoin, utility token, or any SPL token, the presale program provides a secure and feature-rich solution that adapts to your launch strategy.

# How does Meteora Presale work?

The presale program creates a fair and transparent environment for token launches, allowing creators to configure every aspect of their presale while giving participants multiple ways to contribute and claim their tokens.

Contributors deposit quote tokens (like SOL or USDC) during the presale period, and once the presale concludes successfully, they can claim their purchased tokens based on the presale mode and vesting schedule.

## Multiple Presale Modes for Every Launch Strategy

Choose the presale mode that best fits your token launch goals:

### Fixed Price Presale

Sell your tokens at a predetermined fixed price. This is the most straightforward approach where participants know exactly how many tokens they'll receive for their contribution.

**Perfect for**: Projects that want price certainty and predictability for their community.

### First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS)

The token price is dynamically determined based on total contributions. Early participants contribute first, and the presale ends once the maximum cap is reached.

**Perfect for**: Creating urgency and rewarding early supporters who act quickly.

### Prorata (Fair Distribution)

The token price is dynamically determined after the presale ends, and the presale can be oversubscribed. If the maximum cap is exceeded, tokens are distributed proportionally to all participants, and any excess contributions are automatically refunded.

**Perfect for**: Ensuring fair distribution where everyone who participates gets an allocation, regardless of when they joined.

## Flexible Access Control

Control who can participate in your presale with three access modes:

### Permissionless

Anyone can participate in the presale without restrictions. This creates maximum accessibility and allows organic community growth.

### Permissioned with Authority

Only whitelisted addresses approved by the creator can participate. This gives creators full control over who can join their presale, perfect for exclusive or private sales.

### Permissioned with Merkle Proof

Use cryptographic Merkle proofs to whitelist participants efficiently. This approach scales to thousands of addresses while maintaining low on-chain costs.

## Multiple User Tiers (Registries)

Create up to 5 different participation tiers, each with its own:
- **Token allocation**: How many tokens are available for this tier
- **Minimum deposit**: The minimum amount participants must contribute
- **Maximum deposit**: The maximum amount participants can contribute
- **Deposit fees**: Customizable fees for each tier

**Example Use Cases:**
- **Tiered Access**: VIP tier with higher caps, public tier with lower caps
- **Different Fee Structures**: Zero fees for early supporters, small fees for public participants
- **Allocation Management**: Reserve tokens for specific community segments

## Token Lock and Vesting

Protect your launch with comprehensive locking and vesting mechanisms:

**Partial Immediate Release**: Release a percentage of tokens immediately (e.g., 20% unlocked at TGE)

**Lock Period**: Keep purchased tokens locked for a specified duration before vesting begins

**Vesting Period**: Gradually release locked tokens over time, creating a smooth unlock schedule

**Example:**
- **Immediate Release**: 25% of tokens claimable right away
- **Lock Duration**: 30 days where no additional tokens are released
- **Vest Duration**: Remaining 75% unlocks gradually over 180 days

This structure reduces sell pressure while rewarding participants over time.

## Real-Time Participation Tracking

Participants can monitor their position in real-time:
- **Deposit anytime**: Contribute during the presale period (respecting tier caps)
- **Withdraw if needed**: Remove contributions before the presale ends (in most modes)
- **Track allocation**: See your token allocation as the presale progresses
- **Claim when ready**: Claim vested tokens as they unlock

## Automatic Refunds and Overflow Handling

The program automatically handles edge cases:

**Failed Presale**: If the minimum cap isn't reached, all contributions are fully refunded to participants

**Oversubscribed Prorata**: Excess contributions are automatically refunded to maintain fair pricing

**Unsold Tokens**: Configure whether unsold tokens are burned or returned to the creator
