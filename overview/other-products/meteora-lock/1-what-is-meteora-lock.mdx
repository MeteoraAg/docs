# How does Meteora Lock work?

Meteora Lock allows you to lock tokens based on a vesting plan. The vesting plan is defined by the user, specifying how many tokens are released at each time interval.

## Variables

- `vesting_start_time`: The timestamp when the vesting starts.
- `cliff_time`: The timestamp when the cliff period ends and cliff tokens can be unlocked.
- `frequency`: The time interval (in seconds) between each period unlock.
- `cliff_unlock_amount`: The amount of tokens to be unlocked at the cliff.
- `amount_per_period`: The amount of tokens to be unlocked at each period.
- `number_of_period`: The number of periods to be unlocked.

## Formula

### Total Locked Vesting Amount

```math
\text{total\_amount} = \text{cliff\_unlock\_amount} + (\text{amount\_per\_period} \times \text{number\_of\_period})
```

# Benefits

Meteora Lock is made for both projects and users.

    Projects can trustlessly lock tokens for various parties to align incentives. As a project team, you can configure parameters such as vesting, cliff period, unlock schedule. Projects can also burn tokens by setting the recipient wallet address to a burn address and this ensures that actions like dumping are curbed on the team level. These will be embedded into the smart contract and vest accordingly.
