## How Memecoin Pool v2 Fees Work

### Earning Fees from Locked Liquidity

Memecoin projects typically permanently lock liquidity to give traders confidence. However, on most DEX platforms, fees earned by this liquidity are lost, limiting a project's financial options.

**On Meteora**, when a liquidity provider creates a new Memecoin Pool v2, fees remain claimable by the liquidity provider (the wallet that provided the liquidity).

This feature allows creators to:
- Lock up more or all of the supply
- Earn fees by growing volume instead of selling allocations as a source of funding
- Create long-term alignment between projects and holders

### Fee Distribution Model

**LP Fees**: Determined by the Fee Schedule set by the protocol, ranging from 50%-0.25% of each swap through the pool.

**Protocol Fee**: 20% of the LP Fee is allocated as a Protocol Fee that:
- Goes to the Protocol or integrators/trading bots that bring volume to the memecoin pool
- Helps grow the Meteora Treasury
- Incentivizes more integrations with Meteora
- Increases volume to the pool

**Fee Control**: Only the Meteora team can change the Protocol Fee.

## Token Requirements

**Quote Token**: No constraint on the quote token for a Memecoin Pool v2.

**Alpha Vault Integration**: If the Memecoin Pool v2 is being launched with an Alpha Vault, SOL or USDC must be used as the quote token.
