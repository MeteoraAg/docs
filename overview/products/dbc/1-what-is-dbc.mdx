title: "What's DBC?"
description: "Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC) is a fully customisable virtual curve that allows you to create tokens with unique price dynamics."
---

Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC) program is a permissionless launch pool protocol that allows any launch partners to enable their users to launch tokens with customizable virtual curves directly on their platform (e.g. launchpad). This allows their users to create a new token and create a Dynamic Bonding Curve pool where anyone can buy tokens based on that bonding curve.

With direct integration into Jupiter and other trading platforms, traders can trade these launch tokens immediately across all these integrations.

# Customizable Fees

The Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC) virtual pool collects a trading fee on every trade (buy or sell).

- **Protocol Fee:**  
  A portion of each trading fee is allocated to the DBC protocol (20% of the trading fee).

- **Referral Fee:**  
  Swap hosts (such as Jupiter, Photon, or trading bots) can include a referral account in the swap transaction to receive a referral fee, which is taken from the protocol fee (20% of the protocol fee).

- **Fee Sharing in the Bonding Curve:**  
  The remaining trading fee is distributed to the launch partner (80% of the trading fee). This fee can be fee shared between the partner and the token creator.

- **Fee Distribution After Migration:**  
  Once a token has graduated and migrated, the LP tokens are locked for both the partner and the token creator. The ratio of locked LP tokens is determined by the partnerâ€™s configuration. Both the partner and the token creator can claim fees from these locked LP tokens on Meteora DAMM v1 or DAMM v2.

- **Surplus Distribution:**  
  The final swap in the DBC pool may result in a surplus of the quote token. This surplus is distributed as follows:
  - **Creator:** 40%
  - **Partner:** 40%
  - **Meteora (Protocol):** 20%

<Note>This surplus is capped at 20% of the migration quote threshold.</Note>

# Migration

**Automatic Migration**

If the DBC pool reaches a pre-defined quote token or price threshold, the liquidity is automatically migrated to a Dynamic AMM Pool v1 or DAMM v2 Pool on Meteora.

**Manual Migration**

We have built a [manual migration user interface](https://migrator.meteora.ag/) for launchpads building on DBC to easily test the migration process.
