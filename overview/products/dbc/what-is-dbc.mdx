Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC) program is a permissionless launch pool protocol that allows any partners to spin up a launchpad that enables their users to launch tokens with customizable virtual curves directly on their platform.

With direct integration into Jupiter and other trading platforms, traders can trade these tokens immediately across all trading terminals.

# What's a Dynamic Bonding Curve?

A Dynamic Bonding Curve is a **Universal Curve** — an up to 16-point customizable curve system that revolutionizes how liquidity providers can design their strategies. This curve is fully customizable for any launchpad to craft their own unique bonding curve. 

<Note>Each curve point in the Dynamic Bonding Curve is a constant product curve that can be configured to control the token's price action.</Note>

## The Problem with Traditional AMMs

Traditional AMMs have been constrained by rigid curve designs:

- **Capital Inefficiency**: Uniswap V2's constant product spreads liquidity equally across all prices, leaving most capital unused
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: Current AMMs force all LPs in a pool to follow the same curve design
- **Limited Flexibility**: Even concentrated liquidity solutions force LPs into predefined ranges

## How Universal Curve Solves This

Universal Curve enables unprecedented flexibility through:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="16-Point Customization" icon="chart-line" iconType="solid">
    LPs can define up to 16 points along their desired curve, with constant product formula providing smooth transitions between points.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Infinite Range Capability" icon="infinity" iconType="solid">
    Unlike range-based solutions, Universal Curve allows LPs to provide liquidity from 0 to infinity while concentrating capital exactly where needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple Strategies in One Pool" icon="layer-group" iconType="solid">
    Different LPs can use different curve strategies within the same pool — StableSwap efficiency, constant product flexibility, or custom combinations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Recreate Any AMM Design" icon="clone" iconType="solid">
    Universal Curve can replicate Uniswap V2, Curve StableSwap, or create entirely custom strategies tailored to specific needs.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This innovation allows every LP to optimize their individual strategy while contributing to shared pool efficiency — marking the end of the one-size-fits-all AMM era.

# How does it work?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Partner creates a unique config key">
    Partners (launchpads) create a unique configuration key that includes all settings that covers from the Dynamic Bonding Curve creation to the migration of the liquidity to the actual DAMM pool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Creators create DBC token pools">
    Creators (token pool creators) can create a Dynamic Bonding Curve token pool using the partner's config key. This will mint a new token.
    <Note>You cannot create a DBC token pool with an existing token.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trading platforms can swap">
    Trading platforms and trading bots (e.g., Jupiter, Axiom, Photon, etc.) can **immediately** swap with the Dynamic Bonding Curve pool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="DBC reaches minimum quote threshold">
    When the DBC pool reaches a pre-defined minimum quote threshold (specified in the config key), no one can swap with that pool anymore and that pool is prepared for migration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meteora auto migrator service creates a DAMM pool">
    Meteora's auto migrator keeper service then migrates the DBC pool by sending a crank to create a new Meteora Dynamic AMM v1 or v2 pool
  </Step>
  <Step title="LP tokens or NFTs are locked or claimed by partner or creator">
    Upon migration, depending on the pool's config key, LP tokens or NFTs are either locked or claimable by the partner or creator. This is specified in the `creator_lp_percentage`, `partner_lp_percentage`, `creator_locked_lp_percentage` and `partner_locked_lp_percentage` fields.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Customizable Fees

The Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC) virtual pool collects a trading fee on every trade (buy or sell).

- **Protocol Fee:**  
  A portion of each trading fee is allocated to the DBC protocol (Fixed 20% of the trading fee).

- **Referral Fee:**  
  Swap hosts (such as Jupiter, Photon, or trading bots) can include a referral account in the swap transaction to receive a referral fee, which is taken from the protocol fee (Fixed 20% of the protocol fee).

- **Fee Sharing in the Bonding Curve:**  
  The remaining trading fee is distributed to the launch partner (Fixed 80% of the trading fee). This fee can be fee shared between the partner and the token creator.

- **Fee Distribution After Migration:**  
  Once a token has graduated, the LP tokens are locked for both the partner and the token creator. The ratio of locked LP tokens is determined by the partner’s configuration. Both the partner and the token creator can claim fees from these locked LP tokens on Meteora DAMM v1 or DAMM v2.

# Migration

### Automatic Migration

If the DBC pool reaches a pre-defined quote token or price threshold, the liquidity is automatically migrated to a DAMM v1 pool or DAMM v2 Pool on Meteora.

We run 2 auto migrator keepers to migrate DBC pools. These 2 keepers have strict migration quote threshold requirements.

Keeper addresses that we are running:
1. [CQdrEsYAxRqkwmpycuTwnMKggr3cr9fqY8Qma4J9TudY](https://solscan.io/account/CQdrEsYAxRqkwmpycuTwnMKggr3cr9fqY8Qma4J9TudY)
- `pool_config.migration_quote_threshold` requirements:
  - 10 SOL
  - 750 USDC
  - 1500 JUP
2. [DeQ8dPv6ReZNQ45NfiWwS5CchWpB2BVq1QMyNV8L2uSW](https://solscan.io/account/DeQ8dPv6ReZNQ45NfiWwS5CchWpB2BVq1QMyNV8L2uSW)
- `pool_config.migration_quote_threshold` requirements:
  - \>= 750 USD (`quote_mint` token)

<Note>The Migration Keepers only runs on Mainnet.</Note>

### Manual Migration

We have built a [manual migration user interface](https://migrator.meteora.ag/) for launchpads building on DBC to easily test the migration process.

<Note>The Manual Migrator supports both Mainnet and Devnet.</Note>
