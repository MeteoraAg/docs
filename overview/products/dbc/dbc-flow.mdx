# Flow of DBC Pool -> DAMM v1/v2 Pool

## Concepts 
- **Pre-bonding**: DBC pool - where the newly minted token discovers its price. No need for an LP.
- **Post-bonding**: DAMM v1/v2 pool - where the accumulated `quote_mint` tokens in the bonding curve + a portion of the `base_mint` tokens are migrated to form the liquidity pool of the new token
- **Partner**: Launchpad
- **Creator**: Token Pool Creator

## Flow
<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Create DBC Config Key">
    Partner creates a DBC Config Key that consists of the curve shape, migrated pool fee, and many more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Create DBC Token Pool">
    Creator creates a DBC Token Pool with the Partner's DBC Config Key. This action will mint the new token and initialise a DBC Pool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Trade DBC Token Pool">
    The DBC Token Pool is tradeable on all trading terminals and trading bots (including Jupiter Pro, Axiom, Photon, GMGN, BullX etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Migrate to DAMM Pool">
    Once the DBC Token Pool has accumulated enough `quote_mint` tokens (`pool_state::quote_reserve >= pool_config::migration_quote_threshold`), our migrator keeper will automatically migrate the DBC pool to a DAMM Pool.
    <Note>The `migration_quote_threshold` and a portion of the `base_mint` tokens will form the liquidity pool of the DAMM Pool.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5: Trade on graduated DAMM v1/v2 Pool">
    The graduated DAMM v1/v2 Pool is also tradeable on all trading terminals and trading bots (including Jupiter Pro, Axiom, Photon, GMGN, BullX etc.)
  </Step>
