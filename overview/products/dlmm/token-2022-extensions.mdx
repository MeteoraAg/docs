title: Token 2022 Extensions
---

DLMM supports Token 2022 tokens with a variety of extensions, enabling tokens with enhanced functionality to be easily integrated into DLMM pools. These extensions that DLMM supports are categorized based on whether they require a `token_badge` from Meteora or can be used permissionlessly.

## Permissionless Extensions

If your token is a Token 2022 with these extensions, you can use them permissionlessly without any additional setup or approval from Meteora.

The following extensions can be used permissionlessly with DLMM:

- `TransferFeeConfig`
- `MetadataPointer` 
- `TokenMetadata`
- `TransferHook` - Custom transfer logic. Only when both `hook_program` and `hook_authority` are revoked
- `MemoTransfer`
