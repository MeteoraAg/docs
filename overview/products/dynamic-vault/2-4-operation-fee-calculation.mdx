title: "Operation Fee Calculation"
---

When an operator submits a `deposit_strategy` or `withdraw_strategy` transaction (i.e., when assets are rebalanced between lending protocols), we call this the **rebalance crank**.

A fee is collected to the [fee_vault](https://solscan.io/account/9kZeN47U2dubGbbzMrzzoRAUvpuxVLRcjW9XiFpYjUo4#splTransfers) every time the operator sends a rebalance crank. This fee is paid in vault LP SPL tokens and can be seen at the fee_vault address.

Currently, we charge **5% of profit** as the operation (performance) fee.

## Variables

**Before rebalance:**

- `vault.total_amount`: $t_1$
- `lp_mint.total_supply`: $p_1$
- **Virtual price** (value of LP token): $v_1 = t_1 / p_1$

**After rebalance:**

- `vault.total_amount`: $t_2$
- `lp_mint.total_supply`: $p_1$
- **Virtual price**: $v_2 = t_2 / p_1$

---

## Fee Calculation

We charge an operation fee:

<div align="center">
$fee = 0.05 \times (t_2 - t_1)$
</div>

---

## Adjusting Virtual Price After Fee

After deducting the fee, the virtual price becomes:

<div align="center">
$v_{21} = (t_2 - fee) / p_1$
</div>

However, the vault does **not** send tokens directly to the treasury token account (since it may not have enough liquidity). Instead, the vault **mints additional LP tokens** for the fee_vault.

Let $\delta$ be the number of new LP tokens minted for the fee. The new virtual price is:

<div align="center">
$v_{22} = t_2 / (p_1 + \delta)$
</div>

We want the virtual price after fee to remain the same, so set $v_{21} = v_{22}$:

<div align="center">
$(t_2 - fee) / p_1 = t_2 / (p_1 + \delta)$
</div>

---

## Solving for $\delta$

Rearranging the equation above, we get:

<div align="center">
$\delta = (p_1 \times fee) / (t_2 - fee)$
</div>

Or, substituting $fee = 0.05 \times (t_2 - t_1)$:

<div align="center">
$\delta = (p_1 \times 0.05 \times (t_2 - t_1)) / (t_2 - 0.05 \times (t_2 - t_1))$
</div>

Which simplifies to:

<div align="center">
$$
\delta = (p_1 \times 0.05 \times (t_2 - t_1)) / (0.95 \times t_2 + 0.05 \times t_1)
$$
</div>

**Summary:**  
- The operation fee is 5% of the profit from each rebalance crank.
- The fee is paid by minting new LP tokens to the fee_vault, not by transferring underlying assets.
- The number of LP tokens minted is calculated to ensure the virtual price for LP holders remains consistent after the fee is taken.
