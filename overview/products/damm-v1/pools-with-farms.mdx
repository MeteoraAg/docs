title: "Pools with Farms"
---

Our farming program for Dynamic AMM (DAMM v1) Pools allows Liquidity Providers, who deposit in Meteora pools, to stake LP token to earn rewards.

Rewards come from partners with a maximum of 2 reward tokens for a farming pool.

There can be multiple farming pools for a Meteora pool. Farmers should notice on APR and Expiration before staking LP token to a farming pool.

Here are steps to integrate with the farming program:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Stake" icon="steak" iconType="solid">
    Deposit into a Meteora pool to receive LP tokens, which represent your share in the pool. Then, stake your LP tokens in a farming pool to start earning rewards.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Claim" icon="gift" iconType="solid">
    If you have staked LP tokens in a farming pool, you can claim up to two different reward tokens provided by the pool at any time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unstake" icon="unlock" iconType="solid">
    To withdraw from a Meteora pool, first unstake your LP tokens from the farming pool. Once unstaked, you can withdraw your liquidity from the Meteora pool as usual.

# How do I create a new farm?

Farms are permissioned. You can ‚Å†[üé´ÔΩúopen-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/841152225564950528/1200395730758668318) and the team can help create one for you. We need the following info:

1. Link to the pool you want to create a farm for
2. Token mint address for the reward token you want to give. You can specify up to two types of tokens (optional).
3. Duration the farm will run. We recommend 4 weeks. Whenever you add rewards it resets the farm duration. So for a 4 week farm, if you upload rewards at week 2, it will reset and distribute whatever rewards in the farm for 4 more weeks.
4. A wallet address for us to whitelist. This wallet will be able to load the farming rewards into a Dynamic AMM Farm, using our farm admin dashboard (link will be given to you).
5. Once rewards are added into the farm, they cannot be removed. Sometimes, at the end of the farm period, there could be spare rewards remaining due to 0 LP stakers in the farm during the farm period. These remaining rewards can be linearly distributed again if you extend the farm period.

## **For Dynamic AMM Farms**

- You can load rewards on your own using the farm admin dashboard that we will provide or via the [farming ts-sdk](https://github.com/MeteoraAg/reward-pool).

## **For DLMM farms**

- Meteora has to load the farming rewards on your behalf, so you have to send the rewards to us first.
- Then create the pool, add liquidity, and we can load the farming rewards.
- For now, not possible to start the farm at the exact same time as the pool.
- For more info on how rewards are distributed on DLMM farms, please read this page on [DLMM Farming Rewards](/overview/products/dlmm/5-dlmm-farming-rewards).
