title: "Pools with Farms"
---

Our farming program for Dynamic AMM (DAMM v1) Pools allows Liquidity Providers, who deposit in Meteora pools, to stake LP token to earn rewards.

Rewards come from partners with a maximum of 2 reward tokens for a farming pool.

There can be multiple farming pools for a Meteora pool. Farmers should notice on APR and Expiration before staking LP token to a farming pool.

Here are steps to integrate with the farming program:

    Deposit into a Meteora pool to receive LP tokens, which represent your share in the pool. Then, stake your LP tokens in a farming pool to start earning rewards.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Claim" icon="gift" iconType="solid">
    If you have staked LP tokens in a farming pool, you can claim up to two different reward tokens provided by the pool at any time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unstake" icon="unlock" iconType="solid">
    To withdraw from a Meteora pool, first unstake your LP tokens from the farming pool. Once unstaked, you can withdraw your liquidity from the Meteora pool as usual.

# How do I create a new farm?

<Danger>Farms are permissioned.</Danger>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a Discord Ticket">
    Head to Meteora's [discord](https://discord.gg/meteora) and open a ticket.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Pool Information">
    Provide the following information:
    - DAMM v1 pool address or Link to the pool you want to create a farm for
    - Reward A token mint address 
    - Reward B token mint address (optional)
    - Reward Duration (in seconds) - We recommend 4 weeks
    <Note>Whenever you add rewards it resets the farm duration.</Note>
    <Warning>Once rewards are added into the farm, they cannot be removed.  Sometimes, at the end of the farm period, there could be spare rewards remaining due to 0 LP stakers in the farm during the farm period. These remaining rewards can be linearly distributed again if you extend the farm period.</Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Seed the Pool with Rewards">
    Head to our [rewards admin dashboard](https://meteora-admin-wowcats.vercel.app/) to seed the pool with the rewards or seed the rewards via the [farming ts-sdk](/developer-guide/guides/damm-v1/typescript-sdk/farm-integration).
