Dynamic AMM v2 (DAMM v2) is a brand new constant-product AMM program for liquidity pools, with a set of features to optimize transaction fees and provide greater flexibility for liquidity providers, launchpads, and token launches.

Note: DAMM v2 is a new program, and not an upgrade of the Dynamic AMM v1 program.

## Key Features

### SPL and Token 2022 Support

Users can create pools or add liquidity for tokens that support both SPL and Token 2022 (Transfer Fee, Metadata, MetadataPointer extensions).

All Token 2022 tokens with Metadata pointer, and transfer fee extensions are supported permissionlessly. Token mints with other extensions can be whitelisted by Meteora's admin.

### Dynamic Fee

Pool creator has the option of choosing a Fixed Base Fee only or with an additional Dynamic Fee, which is a variable fee based on price volatility. 

Dynamic Fee helps maximize returns for LPs during periods of higher volatility.
