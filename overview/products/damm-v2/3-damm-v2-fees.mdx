## Total Trading Fee

LPs earn a swap fee from traders when they perform a swap. The total swap fee ($f_s$) will have two components:

1. **A base fee** ($f_b$)
2. **A variable fee** ($f_v$)

The **total swap fee** is calculated as:

<div align="center">
$$f_s = f_b + f_v$$
</div>

The variable fee ($f_v$) is a function of real-time price volatility. The fee rate will be applied to the swap amount in each liquidity bin and distributed proportionally to the LPs in that bin.

LPs can claim these fees whenever they are available.

## Base Fee



## Dynamic Fee (Variable Fee)

The variable fee is the core of the dynamic fee mechanism. It increases with market volatility.

<div align="center">
$$f_v = (v_a \times s)^2 \times C / 100000000000$$
</div>

where:
- **Volatility Accumulator** ($v_a$): A measure of recent price volatility
- **Bin Step** ($s$): A parameter that defines the price granularity for measuring volatility  
- **Variable Fee Control** ($C$): A parameter to control the magnitude of the variable fee

## Volatility Accumulator

The Volatility Accumulator tracks price movements. It's updated with every swap.

<div align="center">
$$v_a = \min(v_{max}, v_r + \Delta p \times 10000)$$
</div>

where:
- **Max Volatility Accumulator** ($v_{max}$): A cap on the volatility measure to prevent fees from becoming excessively high
- **Volatility Reference** ($v_r$): A decayed value of the volatility accumulator
- **Price Change** ($\Delta p$): The price change since the last reference update, measured in "bins"

### Price Change
The price change is calculated based on the change in the square root of the price.

<div align="center">
$$\Delta p = (\sqrt{p_c / p_r} - 1) / s \times 2$$
</div>

where $p_c$ is current price and $p_r$ is reference price.

### Volatility Decay

To ensure that the dynamic fee reflects recent volatility, the Volatility Reference decays over time.

<div align="center">
$$v_r = v_a \times R / 10000$$
</div>

The decay mechanism is based on the time elapsed since the last significant trade:

- If elapsed time < filter period: No change. This ignores very high-frequency trades.
- If filter period ≤ elapsed time < decay period: The volatility reference is reduced.
- If elapsed time ≥ decay period: The volatility reference is reset to 0. This happens if there are no significant trades for an extended period.

## Max Dynamic Fee on DAMM v2 an DBC

Currently, the max dynamic fee on DAMM v2 and DBC is less than or equals to 20% of the Base Fee. 

Example: 
- Base Fee = 1%
- Dynamic Fee = 0.2%
- Total Trading/LP Fee = 1.2%
