# Product Overview

## Core products

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="DLMM" icon="arrows-to-circle" iconType="solid" href="/overview/products/dlmm/1-what-is-dlmm">
    DLMM (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker) gives LPs access to dynamic fees to capitalize on volatility, and precise liquidity concentration all in real-time, with the flexibility to select their preferred volatility strategy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DAMM v2" icon="calculator-simple" iconType="solid" href="/overview/products/damm-v2/1-what-is-damm-v2">
    DAMM v2 (Dynamic Automatic Market Maker v2) is a constant-product AMM, with features that optimize transaction fees and provide greater flexibility for liquidity providers, launchpads, and token launches. DAMM v2 comes with SPL and Token 2022 token support, optional concentrated liquidity, position NFT, dynamic fee, on-chain fee scheduler, new fee claiming mechanism and fee token selection, more flexible liquidity locks, and an in-built farming mechanism. Unlike DAMM v1, DAMM v2 is not integrated with Dynamic Vaults. DAMM v2 is a new program, and not an upgrade of the Dynamic AMM v1 program.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DAMM v1" icon="infinity" iconType="solid" href="/overview/products/damm-v1/1-what-is-damm-v1">
    DAMM v1 (Dynamic Automatic Market Maker v1) is a constant product AMM that supports token prices from 0 to infinity. LPs can earn additional yield by utilizing lending sources alongside traditional swap fees, enhancing their returns.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Bonding Curve" icon="chart-simple" iconType="solid" href="/overview/products/dbc/1-what-is-dbc">
    Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC) is a fully customisable pricing curve that allows you to create and launch tokens with unique price dynamics. Configure your curve in any shape your want with DBC. Tokens trade in a virtual bonding curve and graduate to a Meteora DAMM v1 or v2 when they hit the minimum quote threshold.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Vault" icon="vault" iconType="solid" href="/overview/products/dynamic-vault/1-what-is-dynamic-vault">
    Dynamic Vaults optimize capital utilization by dynamically distributing assets to lending pools, generating yields for liquidity providers (LPs) on DAMM v1 and Memecoin Pools.

## Launch with Meteora

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="DLMM Launch Pools" icon="circle-1" iconType="solid" href="/meteora-launch-pool/meteora-launch-pool-overview">
    Specially-designed DLMM for new token launches. It comes fundamentally equipped with a feature set that makes it optimal for bootstrapping liquidity for new tokens and making the tokens accessible on Jupiter and other trading integrations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memecoin Pools" icon="circle-2" iconType="solid" href="/for-memecoins/dynamic-memecoin-pools">
    A subset of the DAMM v1 pools designed to support memecoin launches with a configurable off-chain fee scheduler. Liquidity you add during pool creation will be permanently locked forever to help raise community confidence, but you can still earn fees on your locked liquidity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stake2Earn Pools" icon="circle-3" iconType="solid" href="/for-memecoins/m3m3-pools">
    Memecoin Pools with a stake-to-earn mechanism built on top of the DAMM v1 pools that allows top token stakers to earn swap fees from locked liquidity.

By implementing these liquidity solutions, Meteora aims to foster a thriving ecosystem on Solana and establish Solana as the ultimate trading hub in DeFi.

## Why Liquidity and Liquidity Providers on Solana are Important

**Liquidity Pools: The Foundation of DeFi**

Liquidity pools are the backbone of decentralized finance. No matter what you're building—whether it's a new token, a DApp, or a DeFi service—it all starts with liquidity. For example, if you're launching a new token, you begin with nothing. You need to create a liquidity pool to enable swaps between your token and others.

Moreover, deep liquidity for key tokens like SOL enables smooth liquidation and minimizes bad debt risks within the ecosystem. And deep liquidity for wrapped tokens (e.g., BTC, ETH) on Solana allows users to bridge assets across chains, attracting more users from other blockchain networks.

Most users tend to focus only on the DeFi app experience, overlooking the liquidity that powers it. It's important to remember that behind every trade is a liquidity pool making it possible.

**Endless Ways to Provide Liquidity**

There are countless approaches to being a liquidity provider (LP). You can LP for:

- New token launches
- Memecoins or non-hyped assets
- Market-making strategies
- Major DeFi protocols or smaller experiments

Being an LP isn't one-size-fits-all—it’s a spectrum with endless possibilities.

**A Diverse Range of LPs**

Being an LP can mean very different things depending on who you are and what your goals are. Liquidity provision comes from a wide array of contributors, such as:

- Professional Market Makers
- Developers who integrate liquidity pools into DApps
- Creators who aunch and bootstrap liquidity for new tokens
- Launchpads that help migrate and establish liquidity for new projects
- Everyday DeFi users who provide liquidity directly to earn yield or support projects they believe in

**Liquidity Is the Fuel for Crypto’s Future**

As DeFi continues to evolve, liquidity will become even more critical. The future of crypto doesn’t revolve around centralized exchanges—it lies in decentralized systems. We're heading toward a world where millions of people are launching billions of new tokens.

**Liquidity Pools** will be central to that future. We’ll need new mechanisms for **creating, launching, distributing**, and **maintaining** these tokens—and all of them will depend on liquidity pools. For example

**Liquidity Providers (LPs)** will be the people driving this ecosystem. They’re the ones who create, fund, and maintain the markets that make DeFi possible.

**Launchpads** will play a vital role in this shift, offering platforms for new tokens to be created and launched. The launchpad ecosystem is just getting started—what we have today is only the beginning.
