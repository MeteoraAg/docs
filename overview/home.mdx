## Core products

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="DAMM v1" href="/overview/products/damm-v1/1-what-is-damm-v1" icon="square-1" iconType="solid">
    DAMM v1 (Dynamic Automatic Market Maker v1) is a constant product AMM that supports token prices from 0 to infinity. LPs can earn additional yield by utilizing lending sources alongside traditional swap fees, enhancing their returns.  
  </Card>
  <Card title="DAMM v2" href="/overview/products/damm-v2/1-what-is-damm-v2" icon="square-2" iconType="solid">
    DAMM v2 (Dynamic Automatic Market Maker v2) is a constant-product AMM program, with features that optimize transaction fees and provide greater flexibility for liquidity providers, launchpads, and token launches. DAMM v2 comes with SPL and Token 2022 token support, optional concentrated liquidity, position NFT, dynamic fee, on-chain fee scheduler, new fee claiming mechanism and fee token selection, more flexible liquidity locks, and an in-built farming mechanism. Unlike DAMM v1, DAMM v2 is not integrated with Dynamic Vaults. DAMM v2 is a new program, and not an upgrade of the Dynamic AMM v1 program.

    DLMM (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker) gives LPs access to dynamic fees to capitalize on volatility, and precise liquidity concentration all in real-time, with the flexibility to select their preferred volatility strategy.

  <Card title="DLMM Launch Pools" href="/meteora-launch-pool/meteora-launch-pool-overview" icon="circle-3" iconType="solid">
    Specially-designed DLMM for new token launches. It comes fundamentally equipped with a feature set that makes it optimal for bootstrapping liquidity for new tokens and making the tokens accessible on Jupiter and other trading integrations.

By implementing these innovative liquidity solutions, Meteora aims to foster a thriving ecosystem on Solana and establish Solana as the ultimate trading hub in DeFi.

## Why Liquidity on Solana is Important

- **Facilitating Essential Functions**: Deep liquidity for key tokens like SOL enables smooth liquidation and minimizes bad debt risks within the ecosystem.
- **Attracting Users from Other Chains**: Deep liquidity for wrapped tokens (e.g., BTC, ETH) on Solana allows users to bridge assets across chains, attracting users from other blockchain networks.
- **Boosting Trading Activity**: Introducing new ecosystem tokens like Bonk enhances trading options, stimulating activity and liquidity on Solana.
