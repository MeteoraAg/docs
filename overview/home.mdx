Welcome to Meteora! Our mission is to build the most secure, sustainable and composable liquidity layer for all of Solana and DeFi.

We want to build the best liquidity pools for:
- [Liquidity providers](https://lparmy.meteora.ag/)
- [Launchpads](https://launch.meteora.ag/)
- [Launches](https://www.meteora.ag/)

By using Meteora's DAMM and DLMM Pools, liquidity providers can earn the best fees and yield on their capital.

This would help transform Solana into the ultimate trading hub for mainstream users in crypto by driving sustainable, long-term liquidity to the platform. Join us at Meteora to shape Solana's future as the go-to destination for all crypto participants.

## Product Overview

Meteora leverages sustainable and efficient DeFi products to enhance liquidity on the Solana network:

1. DLMM Pools: Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM) gives LPs access to dynamic fees to capitalize on volatility, and precise liquidity concentration all in real-time, with the flexibility to select their preferred volatility strategy.

2. DLMM Launch Pools: Specially-designed DLMM for new token launches. It comes fundamentally equipped with a feature set that makes it optimal for bootstrapping liquidity for new tokens and making the tokens accessible on Jupiter and other trading integrations.

3. DAMM v1 Pools: Dynamic AMM v1 (DAMM v1) is a constant-product AMM program that supports token prices from 0 to infinity. DAMM v1 is integrated with Dynamic Vaults, where LPs can earn additional yield through utilizing lending sources alongside traditional swap fees, enhancing their returns.

4. DAMM v2 Pools: Dynamic AMM v2 (DAMM v2) is a constant-product AMM program, with features that optimize transaction fees and provide greater flexibility for liquidity providers, launchpads, and token launches. DAMM v2 comes with SPL and Token 2022 token support, optional concentrated liquidity, position NFT, dynamic fee, on-chain fee scheduler, new fee claiming mechanism and fee token selection, more flexible liquidity locks, and an in-built farming mechanism. Unlike DAMM v1, DAMM v2 is not integrated with Dynamic Vaults. DAMM v2 is a new program, and not an upgrade of the Dynamic AMM v1 program.

5. Memecoin Pools: A subset of Dynamic AMM Pools designed to support memecoin launches with a configurable fee scheduler. Liquidity you add during pool creation will be permanently locked forever to help raise community confidence, but you can still earn fees on your locked liquidity.

6. Stake2Earn Pools: Memecoin Pools with a stake-to-earn mechanism that allows top token stakers to earn swap fees from locked liquidity.

7. Dynamic Vaults: Dynamic Vaults optimize capital utilization by dynamically distributing assets to lending pools, generating yields for liquidity providers (LPs) on Dynamic AMM and Memecoin Pools.

8. Non-Pegged Stable Pools (e.g. LST): Tailored for non-pegged assets, these pools maintain the pegged value of assets within the pool, promoting maximum capital efficiency.

9. Multi-token Stable Pools: These pools efficiently combine liquidity from multiple assets into a single pool, enabling LPs to diversify their holdings and optimize capital utilization.

By implementing these innovative liquidity solutions, Meteora aims to foster a thriving ecosystem on Solana and establish Solana as the ultimate trading hub in DeFi.

## Solana as DeFi's trading hub

Solana is best positioned to become the preferred trading hub in DeFi due to its speed, low fees, and scalability. It runs on a single state machine, which means that it is not fragmented between many L2 systems. This allows liquidity and systems built on top of Solana to work seamlessly together.

Currently, Solana's lack of liquidity poses a significant obstacle to user adoption and growth. Meteora aims to address this challenge and drive substantial liquidity to Solana, fostering its widespread adoption and robust growth.

## Why Liquidity on Solana is Important

- **Facilitating Essential Functions**: Deep liquidity for key tokens like SOL enables smooth liquidation and minimizes bad debt risks within the ecosystem.
- **Attracting Users from Other Chains**: Deep liquidity for wrapped tokens (e.g., BTC, ETH) on Solana allows users to bridge assets across chains, attracting users from other blockchain networks.
- **Boosting Trading Activity**: Introducing new ecosystem tokens like Bonk enhances trading options, stimulating activity and liquidity on Solana.

## Meteora's Approach to Driving Liquidity to Solana

We are taking a multi-pronged approach to driving liquidity to Solana. 

<div align="center">
![Meteora's Approach](/images/overview/meteora-approach.avif)
</div>

Firstly, we are focused on constructing sustainable and efficient DeFi protocols that will facilitate long-term liquidity.
Secondly, we will establish a decentralized, transparent, and trusted system, underpinned by a supportive community. 
Lastly, we are forging partnerships with long-term liquidity providers (LPs) who are motivated to contribute liquidity to Meteora and Solana in both the immediate and long term.

## Upcoming Steps

The following section outlines the important next steps to bring us towards our goal of making Solana liquid again.

</div>

### **Kickstart**: Establishing DAO and Governance
In this phase, we will establish the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and governance system for Meteora. Additionally, we will release the locked MET token to our initial stakeholders, who are the supportive Mercurial token holders. These stakeholders have been instrumental in shaping our strategy and plans and we want them to play an important role in the next phase of Meteora where they can vote for important decisions like our token plan as well as pool emissions. This phase is important to help make our project decentralized and transparent - key principals to building trust for attracting liquidity and partner projects to build on top of our systems.

### Bootstrap: Incentivizing Partners and LPs
Working alongside the DAO, we will design incentive systems to encourage partners and liquidity providers (LPs) to contribute initial and long-term liquidity on Meteora and Solana. For example, partners providing initial liquidity will have the opportunity to acquire a stake in Meteora through locked MET tokens. 

### Sustain: Researching Sustainable Liquidity Systems

We will continue researching and building sustainable liquidity systems such that even after the initial common liquidity mining incentive stage is over, there are other forms of incentives to attract and sustain liquidity. 
Our focus includes exploring Concentrated Liquidity and Market Making (CLMM) pools to improve our DLMM, helping to enhance price discovery, reduce slippage for traders and enable yield with fewer tokens deposited. 

These efforts ensure ongoing liquidity and support the long-term success of Meteora and Solana.
