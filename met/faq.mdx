## Overview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is a TGE?">
    A Token Generation Event is when a project's token is first created on-chain and becomes claimable/tradable. It's the "go-live" for supply and distribution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When is the Meteora TGE?">
    23rd October 2025. Exact time will be posted on Meteora's official socials.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="On which chain will the launch be?">
    Solana.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="On which token standard?">
    SPL token. Contract address will be posted only in our official channels at TGE.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Eligibility

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who is eligible to claim?">
    Eligibility is based on points, LP activity, off chain contributions and more. Points are finalised.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I check my allocation?">
    On Meteora's official claim page. Connect your wallet to view eligibility and allocation. Make sure to check the link properly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who is eligible for a Liquidity Distributor NFT position?">
    JUP Stakers will automatically be opted in for a Liquidity Distributor NFT position (3% of supply). The remaining 7% will go to other eligible users on a first come first serve basis, capping the total Liquidity Distributor NFT supply at 10%.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Claim Process

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I claim?">
    1. Open the official TGE claim site from our announcements in discord or 𝕏
    2. Connect a supported wallet (e.g. Phantom, Jup Mobile, Solflare…)
    3. Review your allocation
    4. Approve the on-chain transaction to claim. Typical Solana claim UX follows this pattern
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What wallets/browsers are supported?">
    Phantom/Backpack/Jupiter/Solflare etc. Make sure to keep your wallet/app updated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will my allocation be airdropped or claimed?">
    You will need to manually select "Claim MET".
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need SOL to claim my allocation?">
    Yes. Claiming your allocation is an on-chain process and gas fees are required (Typically ~0.02 SOL). A small amount of SOL is also required to create your token account for MET.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Trading, Liquidity & Listing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where can I trade after TGE?">
    Initial liquidity will be on the Meteora DAMM v2 pool. Other listings, if any, will be announced separately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slippage looks high, why?">
    Early trading can be volatile. Confirm slippage settings, check pool TVL/depth, and beware price impact on large orders.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security & Official Links

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I avoid scams?">
    - Only use links from Discord Announcements, 𝕏 Page and our official website
    - Never DM seed phrases/private keys
    - Never click links in tweets from impersonator accounts
    - Be cautious of fake token/NFT's airdropped to your wallet
    - Confirm the exact token mint address from our channels before swapping
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Token Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the token mint address & decimals?">
    Posted at TGE in announcements and on the claim page. Do not trust addresses posted elsewhere.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Points / Airdrops

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I think my points/allocation are wrong, can you recalculate?">
    Allocations are final. If you believe there’s a technical error on the UI, open a support ticket with wallet + tx links. (See [support policy](#support-policy) below.)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will I receive a MET allocation or an NFT?">
    If you're a JUP Staker, you'll automatically be opted in for a Liquidity Distributor NFT that can be withdrawn at any time when trading goes live. If you are another eligible airdrop recipient, you can decide to get your MET allocation or the NFT position value. The NFT supply is capped at 10% of total MET supply and on a first come first serve basis.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Liquidity Distributor NFT & Launch Pool

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is a Liquidity Distributor NFT?">
    The Liquidity Distributor NFT represents your position in the DAMMv2 launch pool relative to the percentage of the total supply of MET you own. When you close your position from the initial launch DAMMv2 pool the NFT transfers out of your wallet in exchange for your percentage of liquidity within it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the supply of Liquidity Distributor NFT?">
    10% of total MET supply. 3% of this supply will be auto opted in for JUP Stakers. The remaining 7% will be on a first come first serve basis.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the Liquidity Distributor NFT earn fees?">
    Within the DAMMv2 pool, a fee is charged based on swaps. Since the pool is single sided MET you will earn fees when someone swaps their USDC for MET. The pool fees start high and drastically decline overtime through a fee scheduler. 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who can claim a Liquidity Distributor NFT?">
    All JUP Stakers are automatically opted in. The remaining 7% supply will be on a first come first serve basis prior to TGE.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When and where can we opt in for a Liquidity Distributor NFT?">
    On the official TGE site https://met.meteora.ag. The date of claim will be announced on our official socials.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to claim my NFT right away as soon as trading starts to maximise my fees?">
    No, you do not need to rush to claim nor will you miss out on fees claiming your NFT later than everyone. Your fees will still be generating in the pool even if you don't claim them immediately at launch.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I get my MET allocation or an NFT?">
    Unless you're a JUP Staker, that choice is ultimately yours.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the NFT a locked position?">
    No. You can withdraw your position at any time once trading starts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a time limit on how long I can leave the NFT in the pool?">
    No. Leave it for as long as you like.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When TGE goes live, do I need to do anything or will my NFT position be ready?">
    If you selected a Liquidity Position NFT before TGE, no further action is required. Your position will automatically be represented in the pool earning fees. Once you select claim NFT on the site, you are free to manage your position as you wish.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="If I withdraw my NFT position, what do I receive?">
    You will receive your share of liquidity in the pool. This may be a mix of MET and USDC, or primarily MET, depending on pool activity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is it a one-way choice when you register for the Liquidity Distributor NFT?">
    Yes. Once you've signed and confirmed your registration to switch your MET token allocation to MET liquidity Distributor NFT, you cannot change your choice.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is registration for Liquidity Distributor NFT capacity limited? Is there a cap?">
    The allocation is capped at 10% of the total supply (100M). However, this limit may be slightly exceeded to accommodate the final deposit, as a minimal overflow is permitted for the last depositor.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long is the Liquidity Distributor NFT registration period?">
    Until Sunday, 19 October, 23:00 UTC+8
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When does the MET airdrop claim window close?">
    The MET airdrop claim window closes on 23 January 2025 9.00PM SGT. Make sure to claim your tokens before this deadline.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Support Policy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I open a support ticket? What info is required?">
    You can submit a ticket through our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/meteora) channel. Include:
    - Wallet address
    - Transaction links (Solscan)
    - Device/wallet versions
    - Screenshots
    - A brief description of your issue
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Response & resolution times?">
    During TGE volumes are high; we'll triage by severity. Please avoid duplicate tickets.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My claim failed / I received fewer tokens than expected">
    - Check that you’re on the correct wallet and network (Solana).
    - Ensure you have SOL for fees.
    - Refresh and retry; if it persists, open a ticket with your wallet + tx link.
    - For swaps, check slippage, pool TVL, and whether a token has transfer fees (some tokens do enable them).
    - Try switching to a different RPC.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I can't see the token in my wallet">
    Add the token mint address manually or refresh assets.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why did my transaction fail?">
    Try increasing the priority fee caps. If the default/attached priority fee is too low, validators may ignore the transaction during periods of network congestion. If that doesn't work, try switching the RPCs (this can be done by going to "settings").
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does claiming my allocation cost more than expected?">
    In times of network congestion, the priority fee required to land the transaction may increase up to a limit set by the user. Set a priority fee cap that is within your budget.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transaction failed due to insufficient balance">
    To avoid such failures, it is recommended to maintain at least 0.05 SOL in your wallet at all times. This buffer covers base fees and potential additional fees for most transactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will I be charged for failed transactions?">
    No, if a transaction fails, no funds will be deducted.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The transaction showed that it failed, but my Solana balance decreased">
    It is possible that even if a transaction simulation fails, the actual transaction might still be successful. Check if the transaction went through on block scanners (e.g. https://solscan.io/).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tokenomics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Total supply and initial circulating supply?">
    Total supply: 1,000,000,000 tokens. Initial circulating supply: 480,000,000 tokens. 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Total supply of Liquidity Distributor NFTs?">
    10% of total supply.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the DAMMv2 launch pool range?">
    The pool range where liquidity is added is from \$0.50 to \$7.50 (\$500M to \$7.5B FDV).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Compromised Wallets

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="If my wallet is compromised, is there a way that I can change my address to receive my airdrop?">
    If your wallet is compromised, you have the option to report your wallet and forfeit all MET allocations tied to the wallet. There is no option to submit a new address.
