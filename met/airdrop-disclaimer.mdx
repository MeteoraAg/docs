## Purpose and Limitations

The Airdrop Checker is an informational tool provided solely to assist in assessing your preliminary eligibility for the $MET airdrop programme. Results displayed by the Airdrop Checker do not guarantee final eligibility, participation, or any right to receive tokens or rewards. We reserve the right to disqualify participants who are suspected of fraudulent or illegal activities, bypassing eligibility checks, or failing to meet any eligibility criteria. We reserve the right to change our decisions (and accordingly, any results displayed by the Airdrop Checker) on or prior to the occurrence of the airdrop.

Any acquisition of tokens through third parties (including but not limited to exchanges or other holders) shall not establish any relationship of any kind between you and Meteora Comet Limited and/or its affiliates (“we”, “us”) and we expressly disclaim any and all responsibility or liability arising from or in connection with such transfers. Any acquisition of tokens is strictly at your own risk and does not give rise to any rights against us.

We are not liable for any errors, omissions, or potential inaccuracies in the eligibility assessment provided by the Airdrop Checker, nor for any decisions or changes made on or prior to the occurrence of the airdrop that affect the results or accuracy of the eligibility assessment provided by the Airdrop Checker.
